<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">While France was thus passing from general
fanaticism to a large measure of freethought, England was passing by a
less tempestuous path to a hardly less advanced stage of opinion. It
was indeed a bloody age; and in 1535 we have record of nineteen men and
five women of Holland, apparently Anabaptists, who denied the
&ldquo;humanity&rdquo; of Christ and rejected infant baptism and
transubstantiation, being sentenced to be burned alive&mdash;two
suffering at Smithfield, and the rest at other towns, by way of
example. Others in Henry&rsquo;s reign suffered the same penalty for
the same offence; and in 1538 a priest named Nicholson or Lambert,
refusing on the King&rsquo;s personal pressure to recant, was
&ldquo;brent in Smithfield&rdquo; for denying the bodily presence in
the eucharist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2491src" href="#xd21e2491"
name="xd21e2491src">1</a> The first decades of
&ldquo;Reformation&rdquo; in England truly saw the opening of new vials
of blood. More and Fisher and scores of lesser men died as Catholics
for denying the King&rsquo;s &ldquo;supremacy&rdquo; in religion; as
many more for denying the Catholic tenets which the King held to the
last; and not a few by the consent of More and Fisher for translating
or circulating the sacred books. Latimer, martyred under Mary, had
applauded the burning of the Anabaptists. One generation slew for
denial of the humanity of Christ; the next for denial of his divinity.
Under Edward VI there were burned no Catholics, but several heretics,
including Joan Bocher and a Dutch Unitarian, George Van Pare, described
as a man of saintly life.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2497src" href=
"#xd21e2497" name="xd21e2497src">2</a> Still the English evolution was
less destructive than the French or the German, and the comparative
bloodlessness of the strife between Protestant and Catholic under
Mary<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2503src" href="#xd21e2503" name=
"xd21e2503src">3</a> and Elizabeth, the treatment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>of the
Jesuit propaganda under the latter queen as a political rather than a
doctrinal question,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2514src" href=
"#xd21e2514" name="xd21e2514src">4</a> prevented any such vehemence of
recoil from religious ideals as took place in France. When in 1575 the
law <i lang="la">De h&aelig;retico comburendo</i>, which had slept for
seventeen years, was set to work anew under Elizabeth, the first
victims were Dutch Anabaptists. Of a congregation of them at Aldgate,
twenty-seven were imprisoned, of whom ten were burned, and the rest
deported. Two others, John Wielmacker and Hendrich Ter Woort, were
anti-Trinitarians, and were burned accordingly. Foxe appealed to the
Queen to appoint any punishment short of death, or even that of
hanging, rather than the horrible death by burning; but in vain.
&ldquo;All parties at the time concurred&rdquo; in approving the course
taken.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2527src" href="#xd21e2527" name=
"xd21e2527src">5</a> Orthodoxy was rampant.</p>
<p class="par">Unbelief, as we have seen, however, there certainly was;
and it is recorded that Walter, Earl of Essex, on his deathbed at
Dublin in 1576, murmured that among his countrymen neither Popery nor
Protestantism prevailed: &ldquo;there was nothing but infidelity,
infidelity, infidelity; atheism, atheism; no religion, no
religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2532src" href="#xd21e2532"
name="xd21e2532src">6</a> And when we turn aside from the beaten paths
of Elizabethan literature we see clearly what is partly visible from
those paths&mdash;a number of freethinking variations from the norm of
faith. Ascham, as we saw, found some semblance of atheism shockingly
common among the travelled upper class of his day; and the testimonies
continue. Edward Kirke, writing his &ldquo;glosses&rdquo; to
Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Shepherd&rsquo;s Calendar</i> in 1578, observes that
&ldquo;it was an old opinion, and yet is continued in some men&rsquo;s
conceit, that men of years have no fear of God at all, or not so much
as younger folk,&rdquo; experience having made them skeptical. Erasmus,
he notes, in his <i>Adages</i> makes the proverb &ldquo;Nemo senex
metuit Jovem&rdquo; signify merely that &ldquo;old men are far from
superstition and belief in false Gods.&rdquo; But Kirke insists that,
&ldquo;his great learning notwithstanding, it is too plain to be
gainsaid that old men are much more inclined to such fond fooleries
than younger men,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2547src" href=
"#xd21e2547" name="xd21e2547src">7</a> apparently meaning that elderly
men in his day were commonly skeptical about divine providence.</p>
<p class="par">Other writers of the day do not limit unbelief to the
aged. Lilly, in his <i>Euphues</i> (1578), referring to England in
general or Oxford in particular as Athens, asks: &ldquo;Be there not
many in Athens which think there is no God, no redemption, no
resurrection?&rdquo; Further, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href=
"#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>he complains that &ldquo;it was openly
reported of an old man in Naples that there was more lightness in
Athens than in all Italy ... more Papists, more <i>Atheists</i>, more
sects, more schisms, than in all the monarchies in the
world&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2563src" href="#xd21e2563"
name="xd21e2563src">8</a> and he proceeds to frame an absurd dialogue
of &ldquo;Euphues and Atheos,&rdquo; in which the latter,
&ldquo;monstrous, yet tractable to be persuaded,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2571src" href="#xd21e2571" name="xd21e2571src">9</a>
is converted with a burlesque facility. Lilly, who writes as a
man-of-the-world believer, is a poor witness as to the atheistic
arguments current; but those he cites are so much better than his own,
up to the point of terrified collapse on the atheist&rsquo;s part, that
he had doubtless heard them. The atheist speaks as a pantheist,
identifying deity with the universe; and readily meets a simple appeal
to Scripture with the reply that &ldquo;whosoever denieth a godhead
denieth also the Scriptures which testifie of him.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2577src" href="#xd21e2577" name=
"xd21e2577src">10</a> But in one of his own plays, played in 1584,
Lilly puts on the stage a glimpse of current controversy in a fashion
which suggests that he had not remained so contemptuously confident of
the self-evident character of theism. In <i>Campaspe</i> (i, 3) he
introduces, undramatically enough, Plato, Aristotle, Cleanthes, Crates,
and other philosophers, who converse concerning &ldquo;natural
causes&rdquo; and &ldquo;supernatural effects.&rdquo; Aristotle is made
to confess that he &ldquo;cannot by natural reason give any reason of
the ebbing and flowing of the sea&rdquo;; and Plato contends against
Cleanthes, &ldquo;searching for things which are not to be
found,&rdquo; that &ldquo;there is no man so savage in whom resteth not
this divine particle, that there is an omnipotent, eternal, and divine
mover, which may be called God.&rdquo; Cleanthes replies that
&ldquo;that first mover, which you term God, is the instrument of all
the movings which we attribute to Nature. The earth ... seasons ...
fruits ... the whole firmament ... and whatsoever else appeareth
miraculous, what man almost of mean capacity but can prove it
natural.&rdquo; Nothing is concluded, and the debate is adjourned.
Anaxarchus declares: &ldquo;I will take part with Aristotle, that there
is <i lang="la">Natura naturans</i>, and yet not God&rdquo;; while
Crates rejoins: &ldquo;And I with Plato, that there is <i lang=
"la">Deus optimus maximus</i>, and not Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It is a curious dialogue to put upon the stage, by the
mouth of children-actors, and the arbitrary ascription to Aristotle of
high theistic views, in a scene in which he is expressly described by a
fellow philosopher as a Naturalist, suggests that Lilly felt the danger
of giving offence by presenting the supreme philosopher as an atheist.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>It is evident, however, both from <i>Euphues</i> and
from <i>Campaspe</i>, that naturalistic views were in some vogue, else
they had not been handled in the theatre and in a book essentially
planned for the general reader. But however firmly held, they could not
be directly published; and a dozen years later, over thirty years after
the outburst of Ascham, we still find only a sporadic and unwritten
freethought, however abundant, going at times in fear of its life.</p>
<p class="par">Private discussion, indeed, there must have been, if
there be any truth in Bacon&rsquo;s phrase that &ldquo;atheists will
ever be talking of that opinion, as if they ... would be glad to be
strengthened by the consent of others&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2603src" href="#xd21e2603" name="xd21e2603src">11</a>&mdash;an
argument which would make short work of the vast literature of
apologetic theism&mdash;but even private talk had need be cautious, and
there could be no publication of atheistic opinions. Printed
rationalism could go no further than such a protest against
superstition as Reginald Scot&rsquo;s <i>Discoverie of Witchcraft</i>
(1584), which, however, is a sufficiently remarkable expression of
reason in an age in which a Bodin held angrily by the
delusion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2612src" href="#xd21e2612" name=
"xd21e2612src">12</a> Elizabeth was herself substantially
irreligious,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2618src" href="#xd21e2618"
name="xd21e2618src">13</a> and preferred to keep the clergy few in

Ministers regarded the Church as part of the State system, and punished
all open or at least aggressive heresy in the manner of the
Inquisition. Yet the imported doctrine of the subjective character of

and other foreign philosophy of the same order found religious
acceptance. A sect called the &ldquo;Family of Love,&rdquo; deriving
from Holland (already &ldquo;a country fruitfull of
heretics&rdquo;),<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2642src" href="#xd21e2642"
name="xd21e2642src">17</a> went so far as to hold that &ldquo;Christ
doth not signify any one person, but a quality whereof many are
partakers&rdquo;&mdash;a doctrine which we have seen ascribed by Calvin
to the <i>libertins</i> of Geneva a generation before;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2651src" href="#xd21e2651" name=

Hetherset, was in 1579 tried by the Bishop and Consistory of Norwich
&ldquo;for that he denyed Christe,&rdquo; and, being found guilty, was
burned, after having had his ears cut off, &ldquo;because he spake

the trial of one John Hilton, clerk in holy orders, before the Upper
House of Convocation on December 22, 1584, on the charge of having
&ldquo;said in a sermon at St. Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields that the
Old and New Testaments are but fables.&rdquo; (Lansdowne MSS. British
Museum, No. 982, fol. 46, cited by Prof. Storojenko, <i>Life of Robert
Greene</i>, Eng. tr. in Grosart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Huth Library&rdquo; ed.
of Greene&rsquo;s Works, i, 39, <i>note</i>.) As Hilton confessed to
the charge and made abjuration, it may be surmised that he had spoken
under the influence of liquor. Even on that view, however, such an
episode tells of a considerable currency of unbelieving criticism.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Apart from constructive heresy, the perpetual religious
dissensions of the time were sure to stimulate doubt; and there
appeared quite a number of treatises directed wholly or partly against
explicit unbelief, as: <i>The Faith of the Church Militant</i>,
translated from the Latin of the Danish divine Hemming (1581), and
addressed &ldquo;to the confutation of the Jewes, Turks, Atheists,
Papists, Hereticks, and all other adversaries of the truth
whatsoever&rdquo;; &ldquo;<i>The Touchstone of True Religion</i> ...
against the impietie of Atheists, Epicures, Libertines, Hippocrites,
and Temporisours of these times&rdquo; (1590); <i>An Enemie to
Atheisme</i>, translated by T. Rogers from the Latin of Avenar (1591);
the preacher Henry Smith&rsquo;s <i>God&rsquo;s Arrow against
Atheists</i> (1593, rep. 1611); an English translation of the second
volume of La Primaudaye&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Acad&eacute;mie
Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, containing a refutation of atheistic doctrine;
and no fewer than three &ldquo;Treatises of the Nature of
God&rdquo;&mdash;all anonymous, the third known to be by Bishop Thomas
Morton&mdash;all appearing in the year 1599.</p>
<p class="par">All this smoke&mdash;eight apologetic treatises in
eighteen years&mdash;implies some fire; and the translator of La
Primaudaye, one &ldquo;T. B.,&rdquo; declares in his dedication that
there has been a general growth of atheism in England and on the
continent, which he traces to &ldquo;that Monster Machiavell.&rdquo;
Among English atheists of that school he ranks the dramatist Robert
Greene, who had died in 1592; and it has been argued, not quite
convincingly, that it was to Machiavelli that Greene had pointed, in
his death-bed recantation <i>A Groatsworth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>of Wit</i>
(1592), as the atheistic instructor of his friend Marlowe,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2759src" href="#xd21e2759" name=
"xd21e2759src">27</a> who introduces &ldquo;Machiavel&rdquo; as cynical
prologist to his <i>Jew of Malta</i>. Greene&rsquo;s own
&ldquo;atheism&rdquo; had been for the most part a matter of bluster
and disorderly living; and we find his zealously orthodox friend Thomas
Nashe, in his <i>Strange News</i> (1592), calling the Puritan zealot
who used the pseudonym of Martin Marprelate &ldquo;a mighty platformer
of atheism&rdquo;; even as his own and Greene&rsquo;s enemy, Gabriel
Harvey, called Nashe an atheist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2771src"
href="#xd21e2771" name="xd21e2771src">28</a> But Nashe in his
<i>Christ&rsquo;s Tears over Jerusalem</i> (1592), though he speaks
characteristically of the &ldquo;atheistical Julian,&rdquo; discusses
contemporary atheism in a fashion descriptive of an actual growth of
the opinion, concerning which he alleges that there is no &ldquo;sect
now in England so scattered [<i>i.e.</i>, so widely spread] as
atheisme.&rdquo; The &ldquo;outward atheist,&rdquo; he declares,
&ldquo;establishes reason as his God&rdquo;; and he offers some
sufficiently primitive arguments by way of confutation. &ldquo;They
follow the Pironicks [<i>i.e.</i>, Pyrrhonists], whose position and
opinion it is that there is no hell or misery but opinion. Impudently
they persist in it, that the late discovered Indians show antiquities
thousands before Adam.&rdquo; For the rest, they not only reject the
miracles of Moses as mere natural expedients misrepresented, but treat
the whole Bible as &ldquo;some late writers of our side&rdquo; treat
the Apocrypha. And Nashe complains feelingly that while the atheists
&ldquo;are special men of wit,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the Romish
seminaries have not allured unto them so many good wits as
atheism,&rdquo; the preachers who reply to them are men of dull
understanding, the product of a system under which preferment is given
to graduates on the score not of capacity but of mere gravity and
solemnity. &ldquo;It is the superabundance of wit,&rdquo; declares
Nashe, &ldquo;that makes atheists: will you then hope to beat them down
with fusty brown-bread dorbellism?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2787src" href="#xd21e2787" name="xd21e2787src">29</a> There had
arisen, in short, a ferment of rationalism which was henceforth never
to disappear from English life.</p>
<p class="par">In 1593, indeed, we find atheism formally charged
against two famous men, <span class="sc">Christopher Marlowe</span> and
Sir <span class="sc">Walter Raleigh</span>, of whom the first is
documentarily connected with Kett, and the second in turn with Marlowe.
An official document,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2798src" href=
"#xd21e2798" name="xd21e2798src">30</a> preserved by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>some chance,
reveals that Marlowe was given&mdash;whether or not over the
wine-cup&mdash;to singularly audacious derision of the received
beliefs; and so explicit is the evidence that it is nearly certain he
would have been executed for blasphemy had he not been privately killed
(1593) while the proceedings were pending. The &ldquo;atheism&rdquo;
imputed to him is not made out in any detail; but many of the other
utterances are notably in keeping with Marlowe&rsquo;s daring temper;
and they amount to unbelief of a stringent kind. In <i>Doctor
Faustus</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2805src" href="#xd21e2805" name=
"xd21e2805src">31</a> he makes Mephistopheles affirm that &ldquo;Hell
hath no limits ... but where we are is hell&rdquo;&mdash;a doctrine
which we have seen to be current before his time; and in his private
talk he had gone much further. Nashe doubtless had him in mind when he
spoke of men of &ldquo;superabundance of wit.&rdquo; Not only did he
question, with Raleigh, the Biblical chronology: he affirmed
&ldquo;That Moyses was but a juggler, and that one Heriots&rdquo;
[<i>i.e.</i>, Thomas Harriott, or Harriots, the astronomer, one of
Raleigh&rsquo;s circle] &ldquo;can do more than he&rdquo;; and
concerning Jesus he used language incomparably more offensive to
orthodox feeling than that of Hamond and Kett. There is more in all
this than a mere assimilation of Machiavelli; though the further saying
&ldquo;that the first beginning of religion was only to keep men in
awe&rdquo;&mdash;put also by Greene [if not by Marlowe], with much
force of versification, in the mouth of a villain-hero in the anonymous
play of <i>Selimus</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2814src" href=
"#xd21e2814" name="xd21e2814src">32</a>&mdash;tells of that influence.
Marlowe was indeed not the man to swear by any master without adding
something of his own. Atheism, however, is not inferrible from any of
his works: on the contrary, in the second part of his famous first play
he makes his hero, described by the repentant Greene as the
&ldquo;atheist Tamburlaine,&rdquo; declaim of deity with signal
eloquence, though with a pantheistic cast of phrase. In another
passage, a Moslem personage claims to be on the side of a Christ who
would punish perjury; and in yet another the hero is made to trample
under foot the pretensions of Mohammed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2817src" href="#xd21e2817" name="xd21e2817src">33</a> It was
probably his imputation of perjury to Christian rulers in particular
that earned for Marlowe the malignant resentment which inspired the
various edifying comments published after his unedifying death. Had he
not perished as he did in a tavern brawl, he might have had the nobler
fate of a martyr.</p>
<p class="par">Concerning Raleigh, again, there is no shadow of proof
of atheism, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>though his circle, which included the Earls of
Northumberland and Oxford, was called a &ldquo;school of atheism&rdquo;
in a Latin pamphlet by the Jesuit Parsons,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2826src" href="#xd21e2826" name="xd21e2826src">34</a> published
at Rome in 1593; and this reputation clung to him. It is matter of
literary history, however, that he, like Montaigne, had been influenced
by the <i>Hypotyposes</i> of Sextus Empiricus;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2841src" href="#xd21e2841" name="xd21e2841src">35</a> his short
essay <i>The Sceptick</i> being a na&iuml;f exposition of the thesis
that &ldquo;the sceptick doth neither affirm neither deny any position;
but doubteth of it, and applyeth his Reason against that which is
affirmed, or denied, to justifie his non-consenting.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2848src" href="#xd21e2848" name=
"xd21e2848src">36</a> The essay itself, nevertheless, proceeds upon a
set of wildly false propositions in natural history, concerning which
the adventurous reasoner has no doubts whatever; and altogether we may
be sure that his artificial skepticism did not carry him far in
philosophy. In the <i>Discovery of Guiana</i> (1600) he declares that
he is &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; of the truth of the stories of men whose
heads grow beneath their shoulders; and in his <i>History of the
World</i> (1603&ndash;16) he insists that the stars and other celestial
bodies &ldquo;incline the will by mediation of the sensitive
appetite.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2859src" href="#xd21e2859"
name="xd21e2859src">37</a> In other directions, however, he was less
credulous. In the same <i>History</i> he points out, as Marlowe had
done in talk, how incompatible was such a phenomenon as the mature
civilization of ancient Egypt in the days of Abraham with the orthodox
chronology.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2865src" href="#xd21e2865" name=
"xd21e2865src">38</a> This, indeed, was heresy enough, then and later,
seeing that not only did Bishop Pearson, in 1659, in a work on <i>The
Creed</i> which has been circulated down to the nineteenth century,
indignantly denounce all who departed from the figures in the margin of
the Bible; but Coleridge, a century and a half later, took the very
instance of Egyptian history as triumphantly establishing the accuracy
of the Bible record against the French atheists.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2872src" href="#xd21e2872" name="xd21e2872src">39</a> As regards
Raleigh&rsquo;s philosophy, the evidence goes to show only that he was
ready to read a Unitarian essay, presumably that already mentioned,
supposed to be Kett&rsquo;s; and that he had intercourse with Marlowe
and others (in particular his secretary, Harriott) known to be
freethinkers. A prosecution begun against him on this score, at the
time of the inquiry concerning Marlowe (when Raleigh was in disgrace
with the Queen), came to nothing. It had been led up to by a
translation of Parsons&rsquo;s pamphlet, which affirmed that his
private group was known as &ldquo;Sir Walter Rawley&rsquo;s school of
Atheisme,&rdquo; and that therein &ldquo;both <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>Moyses
and our Savior, the Old and the New Testaments, are jested at, and the
scholars taught among other things to spell God
backwards.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2880src" href="#xd21e2880"
name="xd21e2880src">40</a> This seems to have been idle gossip, though
it tells of unbelief somewhere; and Raleigh&rsquo;s own writings always
indicate<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2889src" href="#xd21e2889" name=
"xd21e2889src">41</a> belief in the Bible; though his dying speech and
epitaph are noticeably deistic. That he was a deist, given to free
discussion, seems the probable truth.</p>
<p class="par">In passing sentence at the close of Raleigh&rsquo;s
trial for treason in 1603, in which his guilt is at least no clearer
than the inequity of the proceedings, Lord Chief Justice Popham
unscrupulously taunted him with his reputation for heresy. &ldquo;You
have been taxed by the world with the defence of the most heathenish
and blasphemous opinions, which I list not to repeat, because Christian
ears cannot endure to hear them, nor the authors and maintainers of
them be suffered to live in any Christian commonwealth. You know what
men said of Harpool.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2897src" href=
"#xd21e2897" name="xd21e2897src">42</a> If the preface to his
<i>History of the World</i>, written in the Tower, be authentic,
Raleigh was at due pains to make clear his belief in deity, and to
repudiate alike atheism and pantheism. &ldquo;I do also account
it,&rdquo; he declares, &ldquo;an impiety monstrous, to confound God
and Nature, be it but in terms.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2909src" href="#xd21e2909" name="xd21e2909src">43</a> And he is
no more tolerant than his judge when he discusses the question of the
eternity of the universe, then the crucial issue as between orthodoxy
and doubt. &ldquo;Whosoever will make choice rather to believe in
eternal deformity [=want of form] or in eternal dead matter, than in
eternal light and eternal life, let eternal death be his reward. For it
is a madness of that kind, as wanteth terms to express
it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2912src" href="#xd21e2912" name=
"xd21e2912src">44</a> Inasmuch as Aristotle was the great authority for
the denounced opinion, Raleigh is anti-Aristotelean. &ldquo;I shall

the lantern of Aristotle&rsquo;s brains.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2917src" href="#xd21e2917" name="xd21e2917src">45</a> But in the
whole preface there is only one, and that a conventional, expression of
belief in the Christian dogma of salvation; and as to that we may note
his own words: &ldquo;We are all in effect become comedians in
religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2923src" href="#xd21e2923"
name="xd21e2923src">46</a> Still, untruthful as he certainly
was,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2928src" href="#xd21e2928" name=
"xd21e2928src">47</a> we may take him as a convinced theist of the
experiential school, standing at the ordinary position of the deists of
the next century.</p>
<p class="par">Notably enough, he anticipates the critical position of
Hume as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>to reason and experience: &ldquo;That these and
these be the causes of these and these effects, time hath taught us and
not reason; and so hath experience without art.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2938src" href="#xd21e2938" name=
"xd21e2938src">48</a> Such utterance, if not connected with professions
of piety, might in those days give rise to such charges of unbelief as
were so freely cast at him. But the charges seem to have been in large
part mere expressions of the malignity which religion so normally
fosters, and which can seldom have been more bitter than then. Raleigh
is no admirable type of rectitude; but he can hardly have been a worse
man than his orthodox enemies. And we must estimate such men in full
view of the low standards of their age.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The belief about Raleigh&rsquo;s atheism was so
strong that we have Archbishop Abbot writing to Sir Thomas Roe on Feb.
19, 1618&ndash;1619, that Raleigh&rsquo;s end was due to his
&ldquo;questioning&rdquo; of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s being and
omnipotence.&rdquo; It is asserted by Francis Osborn, who had known
Raleigh, that he got his title of <i>Atheist</i> from Queen Elizabeth.
See the preface (<i>Author to Reader</i>) to Osborn&rsquo;s
<i>Miscellany of Sundry Essays</i>, etc., in 7th ed. of his
<i>Works</i>, 1673. As to atheism at Elizabeth&rsquo;s court see J. J.
Tayler, <i>Retrospect of Relig. Life of England</i>, 2nd ed. p. 198,
and ref. Lilly makes one of his characters write of the ladies at court
that &ldquo;they never jar about matters of religion, because they
never mean to reason of them&rdquo; (<i>Euphues</i>, Arber&rsquo;s ed.
p. 194).</p>
<p class="par">A curious use was made of Raleigh&rsquo;s name and fame
after his death for various purposes. In 1620 or 1621 appeared
&ldquo;<i lang="la">Vox Spiritus</i>, or Sir Walter Rawleigh&rsquo;s
Ghost; a Conference between Signr. Gondamier ... and Father
Bauldwine&rdquo;&mdash;a &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; tract by one Captain
Gainsford. It appears to have been reprinted in 1622 as &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Prosopoeia</i>. Sir Walter Rawleigh&rsquo;s Ghost.&rdquo; Then in
1626 came a new treatise, &ldquo;Sir Walter Rawleigh&rsquo;s Ghost, or
England&rsquo;s Forewarner,&rdquo; published in 1626 at Utrecht by
Thomas Scott, an English minister there, who was assassinated in the
same year. The title having thus had vogue, there was published in 1631
&ldquo;<i>Rawleigh&rsquo;s Ghost</i>, or, a Feigned Apparition of Syr
Walter Rawleigh to a friend of his, for the translating into English
the Booke of Leonard Lessius (that most learned man), entituled
<i lang="la">De Providentia Numinis et animi immortalitate</i>, written
against the Atheists and Polititians of these days.&rdquo; The
translation of a Jesuit&rsquo;s treatise (1613) thus accredited
purports to be by &ldquo;A. B.&rdquo; In a reprint of 1651 the
&ldquo;feigned&rdquo; disappears from the title-page; but &ldquo;Sir
Walter Rawleigh&rsquo;s Ghost&rdquo; remains to attract readers; and
the translation, now purporting to be by John Holden, who claims to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>have been a friend of Raleigh&rsquo;s, is
dedicated to his son Carew. In the preface the Ghost adjures the
translator (who professes to have heard him frequently praise the
treatise of Lessius) to translate the work with Raleigh&rsquo;s name on
the title, so as to clear his memory of &ldquo;a foul and most unjust
aspersion of me for my presumed denial of a deity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The latest documentary evidence as to the case of
Marlowe is produced by Mr. F. S. Boas in his article, &ldquo;New Light
on Marlowe and Kyd,&rdquo; in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, February,
1899, reproduced in his edition of the works of Thomas Kyd (Clarendon
Press, 1901). In addition to the formerly known data as to
Marlowe&rsquo;s &ldquo;atheism,&rdquo; it is now established that
Thomas Kyd, his fellow dramatist, was arrested on the same charge, and
that there was found among his papers one containing &ldquo;vile
hereticall conceiptes denyinge the divinity of Jhesus Christe our
Saviour.&rdquo; This Kyd declared he had had from Marlowe, denying all
sympathy with its view. <i>Nevertheless, he was put to the torture.</i>
The paper, however, proves to be a vehement Unitarian argument on
Scriptural grounds, and is much more likely to have been written by
Francis Kett than by Marlowe. In the MSS. now brought to light, one
Cholmeley, who &ldquo;confessed that he was persuaded by
Marlowe&rsquo;s reasons to become an Atheiste,&rdquo; is represented by
a spy as speaking &ldquo;all evil of the Counsell, saying that they are
all Atheistes and Machiavillians, especially my Lord Admirall.&rdquo;
The same &ldquo;atheist,&rdquo; who imputes atheism to others as a
vice, is described as regretting he had not killed the Lord Treasurer,
&ldquo;sayenge that he could never have done God better
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For the rest, the same spy tells that Cholmeley believed
Marlowe was &ldquo;able to shewe more sound reasons for Atheisme than
any devine in Englande is able to geve to prove devinitie, and that
Marloe told him that he hath read the Atheist lecture to Sir Walter
Raleigh and others.&rdquo; On the last point there <span class="corr"
id="xd21e2989" title="Source: it">is</span> no further evidence, save
that Sir Walter, his dependent Thomas Harriott, and Mr. Carewe Rawley,
were on March 21, 1593&ndash;1594, charged upon sworn testimonies with
holding &ldquo;impious opinions concerning God and Providence.&rdquo;
There was, however, no prosecution. Harriott had published in 1588 a
work on his travels in Virginia, at the close of which is a passage in
the devoutest vein telling of his missionary labours (quoted by Mr.
Boas, art. cited, p. 225). Yet by 1592 he had, with his master, a
reputation for atheism; and that it was not wholly on the strength of
his great scientific knowledge is suggested by the statement of Anthony
&agrave; Wood that he &ldquo;made a philosophical theology, wherein he
cast off the Old Testament.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Of this no trace remains; but it is established that he
was a highly accomplished mathematician, much admired by Kepler;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>and that he &ldquo;applied the telescope to
celestial purposes almost simultaneously with Galileo&rdquo; (art.
<span class="sc">Harriott</span> in <i>Dict. of Nat. Biog.</i>; cp.
art. in <i>Encyc. Brit.</i>). &ldquo;Harriott ... was the first who
dared to say A=B in the form A &ndash; B = 0, one of the greatest
sources of progress ever opened in algebra&rdquo; (Prof. A. De Morgan,
<i>Newton, his Friend and his Niece</i>, 1885, p. 91). Further, he
improved algebraic notation by the use of small italic letters in place
of Roman capitals, and threw out the hypothesis of secondary planets as
well as of stars invisible from their size and distance. &ldquo;He was
the first to verify the results of Galileo.&rdquo; Rev. Baden Powell,

<p class="par">Against the aspersion of Harriott at Raleigh&rsquo;s
trial may be cited the high panegyric of Chapman, who terms him
&ldquo;my admired and soul-loved friend, master of all essential and
true knowledge,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3018src" href=
"#xd21e3018" name="xd21e3018src">49</a> and one &ldquo;whose judgment
and knowledge, in all kinds, I know to be incomparable and bottomless,
yea, to be admired as much as his most blameless life, and the right
sacred expense of his time, is to be honoured and reverenced&rdquo;;
with a further &ldquo;affirmation of his clear unmatchedness in all
manner of learning.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3024src" href=
"#xd21e3024" name="xd21e3024src">50</a></p>
<p class="par">The frequency of such traces of rationalism at this
period is to be understood in the light of the financial and other
scandals of the Reformation; the bitter strifes of Church and dissent;
and the horrors of the wars of religion in France, concerning which
Bacon remarks in his essay <i>Of Unity in Religion</i> that the
spectacle would have made Lucretius &ldquo;seven times more Epicure and
atheist than he was.&rdquo; The proceedings against Raleigh and Kyd,
accordingly, did not check the spread of the private avowal of
unbelief. A few years later we find Hooker, in the Fifth Book of his
<i>Ecclesiastical Polity</i> (1597), bitterly declaring that the
unbelievers in the higher tenets of religion are much strengthened by
the strifes of believers;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3035src" href=
"#xd21e3035" name="xd21e3035src">51</a> as a dozen years earlier Bishop
Pilkington told of &ldquo;young whelps&rdquo; who &ldquo;in corners
make themselves merry with railing and scoffing at the holy
scriptures.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3041src" href=
"#xd21e3041" name="xd21e3041src">52</a> And in the <i>Treatise of the
Nature of God</i>, by Bishop Thomas Morton (1599), a quasi-dialogue in
which the arguing is all on one side, the passive interlocutor
indicates, in the process of repudiating them, a full acquaintance with
the pleas of those who &ldquo;would openly profess themselves to be of
that [the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>atheistic] judgment, and as far as they might
without danger defend it by argument against any whatever.&rdquo; The
pleas include the lack of moral control in the world, the evidences of
natural causation, the varieties of religious belief, and the
contradictions of Scripture. And such atheists, we are told,
&ldquo;make nature their God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3055src" href="#xd21e3055" name="xd21e3055src">53</a></p>
<p class="par">From Hooker&rsquo;s account also it is clear that, at
least with comparatively patient clerics like himself, the freethinkers
would at times deliberately press the question of theism, and avow the
conviction that belief in God was &ldquo;a kind of harmless error, bred
and confirmed by the sleights of wiser men.&rdquo; He further notes
with even greater bitterness that some&mdash;an &ldquo;execrable
crew&rdquo;&mdash;who were themselves unbelievers, would in the old
pagan manner argue for the fostering of religion as a matter of State
policy, herein conning the lesson of Machiavelli. For his own part
Hooker was confessedly ill-prepared to debate with the atheists, and
his attitude was not fitted to shake their opinions. His one resource
is the inevitable plea that atheists are such for the sake of throwing
off all moral restraint<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3060src" href=
"#xd21e3060" name="xd21e3060src">54</a>&mdash;a theorem which could
hardly be taken seriously by those who knew the history of the English
and French aristocracies, Protestant and Catholic, for the past hundred
years. Hooker&rsquo;s own measure of rationalism, though remarkable as
compared with previous orthodoxy, went no further than the application
of the argument of Pecock that reason must guide and control all resort
to Scripture and authority;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3065src" href=
"#xd21e3065" name="xd21e3065src">55</a> and he came to it under stress
of dispute, as a principle of accommodation for warring believers, not
as an expression of any independent skepticism. When his pious
antagonist Travers cited him as saying that &ldquo;his best author was
his own reason&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3073src" href=
"#xd21e3073" name="xd21e3073src">56</a> he was prompt to reply that he
meant &ldquo;true, sound, divine reason; ... reason proper to that
science whereby the things of God are known; theological reason, which
out of principles in Scripture that are plain, soundly deduceth more
doubtful inferences.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3078src" href=
"#xd21e3078" name="xd21e3078src">57</a> Of the application of rational
criticism to Scriptural claims he had no idea. The unbelievers of his
day were for him a frightful portent, menacing all his plans of
orthodox toleration; and he would have had them put down by
force&mdash;a course which in some cases, as we have seen, had in that
age been actually taken, and was always apt to be resorted to. But
orthodoxy all the while had a sure support in the social and political
conditions which made impossible the publication <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>of
rationalistic opinions. While the whole machinery of public doctrine
remained in religious hands or under ecclesiastical control, the mass
of men of all grades inevitably held by the traditional faith. What is
remarkable is the amount of unbelief, either privately explicit or
implicit in the higher literature, of which we have trace.</p>
<p class="par">Above all there remains the great illustration of the
rationalistic spirit of the English literary renascence of the
sixteenth century&mdash;the drama of <span class=
"sc">Shakespeare</span>. Of that it may confidently be said that every
attempt to find for it a religious foundation has failed.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3090src" href="#xd21e3090" name=
"xd21e3090src">58</a> Gervinus, while oddly suggesting that &ldquo;in
not only not seeking a reference to religion in his works, but in
systematically avoiding it even when opportunity offered,&rdquo;
Shakespeare was keeping clear of an embroilment with the clergy,
nevertheless pronounces the plays to be wholly secular in spirit. While
contending that &ldquo;in action the religious and divine in man is
nothing else than the moral,&rdquo; the German critic admits that
Shakespeare &ldquo;wholly discarded from his works ... that which
religion enjoins as to faith and opinion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3096src" href="#xd21e3096" name="xd21e3096src">59</a> And, while
refusing the inference of positive unbelief on the poet&rsquo;s part,
he pronounces that, &ldquo;Just as Bacon banished religion from
science, so did Shakespeare from art.... From Bacon&rsquo;s example it
seems clear that Shakespeare left religious matters unnoticed on the
same grounds.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3101src" href=
"#xd21e3101" name="xd21e3101src">60</a> The latest and weightiest
criticism comes to the same conclusion; and it is only on
presupposition that any other can be reached. One of the ablest of
Shakespearean critics sums up that &ldquo;the Elizabethan drama was
almost wholly secular; and while Shakespeare was writing he practically
confined his view to the world of non-theological observation and
thought, so that he represents it in substantially one and the same way
whether the period of the story is pre-Christian or
Christian.&rdquo;</p>

on <i>Hamlet</i>, Professor Bradley slightly modifies this statement,
suggesting that the ghost is made to appear as &ldquo;the
representative of the hidden ultimate power, the messenger of divine
justice&rdquo; (p. 174). Here, it seems to the present writer,
Professor Bradley obtrudes the chief error of his admirable
book&mdash;the constant implication that Shakespeare planned his plays
as moral wholes. The fact is that he found the ghost an integral part
of the old play which he rewrote; and in making it, in Professor
Bradley&rsquo;s words, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"

he was simply heightening the character as he does others in the play,
and as was his habit in the presentment of a king. In his volume of
lectures entitled <i>Oxford Lectures on Poetry</i> (1909), Professor
Bradley goes more fully into the problem of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
religion. Here he somewhat needlessly obscures the issue by contending
(p. 349) that it is preposterous to suppose that Shakespeare was
&ldquo;an <i>ardent and devoted</i> atheist or Brownist or Roman
Catholic,&rdquo; and makes the most of the poet&rsquo;s sympathetic
treatment of religious types and religious sentiments; but still sums
up that he &ldquo;was not, in the distinctive sense of the word, a
religious man,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;all was, for him, in the end,
mystery&rdquo; (p. 353).]</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This perhaps somewhat understates the case. The
Elizabethan drama was not wholly secular;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3133src" href="#xd21e3133" name="xd21e3133src">61</a> and
certainly the dramatists individually were not. Peele&rsquo;s <i>David
and Bethsabe</i> is wholly Biblical in theme, and, though sensual in
sentiment, substantially orthodox in spirit; and elsewhere he has many
passages of Protestant and propagandist fervour.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3139src" href="#xd21e3139" name="xd21e3139src">62</a> Greene and
Lodge give a highly Scriptural ring to their <i>Looking-Glass for
London</i>; and Lodge, who uses religious expressions freely in his
early treatise, <i>A Defence of Poetry, Music, and Stage
Plays</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3155src" href="#xd21e3155" name=
"xd21e3155src">63</a> later translated Josephus. Kyd in <i>Arden of
Feversham</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3160src" href="#xd21e3160"
name="xd21e3160src">64</a> accepts the Christian view at the close,
though <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i> is pagan; and the pre-Shakespearean
<i>King Leir and his Three Daughters</i> (1594), probably the work of
Kyd and Lodge, has long passages of specifically Christian sentiment.
Nashe, again, was a hot religious controversialist despite his Bohemian
habits and his indecorous vein; Greene on his repentant deathbed was
profusedly censorious of atheism;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3169src"
href="#xd21e3169" name="xd21e3169src">65</a> Lilly, as we have seen, is
combatively theistic in his <i>Campaspe</i>; while Jonson, as we shall
see, girds at skeptics in <i>Volpone</i> and <i>The Magnetick Lady</i>,
and further wrote a quantity of devotional verse. Even the
&ldquo;atheist&rdquo; Marlowe, as we saw, puts theistic sentiment into
the mouth of his &ldquo;atheist Tamburlaine&rdquo;; and of <i>Doctor
Faustus</i>, despite incidental heresy, the <i lang=
"fr">d&eacute;nouement</i> is religiously orthodox. Thomas Heywood may
even be pronounced a religious man,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3191src"
href="#xd21e3191" name="xd21e3191src">66</a> as he was certainly a
strong Protestant,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3204src" href=
"#xd21e3204" name="xd21e3204src">67</a> though an anti-Puritan; and his
prose treatise <i>The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels</i> (1635)
exhibits a religious temperament. The same may be said of Dekker, who
is recorded to have written at least the prologue and the epilogue for
a play on Pontius Pilate,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3215src" href=
"#xd21e3215" name="xd21e3215src">68</a> and is believed to be the
author of the best scenes in <i>The Virgin Martyr</i>, in which he
collaborated with Massinger. He too uses supererogatory religious
expressions,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3221src" href="#xd21e3221"
name="xd21e3221src">69</a> and shows his warm Protestantism in <i>The
Whore of Babylon</i>, as he does his general religious sentiment in his
treatise <i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i>. Chapman was certainly a devout
theist, and probably a Christian. In the &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;
tragedy, <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i> (1599), which is conjecturally
ascribed to Lodge, the conclusion is on Christian lines, as in
<i>Arden</i>; and the same holds of <i>The Witch of Edmonton</i>, by
Dekker and others. Of none of these dramatists could it be said, on the
mere strength of his work, that he was &ldquo;agnostic,&rdquo; though
Marlowe was certainly a freethinker. The others were, first or last,
avowedly religious. Shakespeare, and Shakespeare alone, after Marlowe,
is persistently non-religious in his handling of life. <i>Lear</i>, his
darkest tragedy, is predominantly pagan; and <i>The Tempest</i>, in its
serener vein, is no less so. But indeed all the genuine plays alike
ignore or tacitly negate the idea of immortality; even the conventional
religious phrases of Macbeth being but incidental poetry.</p>
<p class="par">In the words of a clerical historian, &ldquo;the
religious phrases which are thinly scattered over his work are little
more than expressions of a distant and imaginative reverence. And on
the deeper grounds of religious faith his silence is significant....
The riddle of life and death ... he leaves ... a riddle to the last,
without heeding the common theological solutions around
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3272src" href="#xd21e3272" name=
"xd21e3272src">70</a> The practical wisdom in which he rose above his
rivals no less than in dramatic and poetic genius, kept him prudently
reticent on his opinions, as it set him upon building his worldly
fortunes while the others with hardly an exception lived in shallows
and miseries. As so often happens, it was among the ill-balanced types
that there was found the heedless courage to cry aloud what others
thought; but Shakespeare&rsquo;s significant silence reminds us that
the largest spirits <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18"
name="pb18">18</a>]</span>of all could live in disregard of
contemporary creeds. For, while there is no record of his having
privately avowed unbelief, and certainly no explicit utterance of it in
his plays,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3286src" href="#xd21e3286" name=
"xd21e3286src">71</a> in no genuine work of his is there any more than
bare dramatic conformity to current habits of religious speech; and
there is often significantly less. In <i>Measure for Measure</i> the
Duke, counselling as a friar the condemned Claudio, discusses the
ultimate issues of life and death without a hint of Christian
credence.</p>
<p class="par">So silent is the dramatist on the ecclesiastical issues
of his day that Protestants and Catholics are enabled to go on
indefinitely claiming him as theirs; the latter dwelling on his
generally kindly treatment of friars; the former citing the fact that
some Protestant preacher&mdash;evidently a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his
daughter Susannah&mdash;was allowed lodging at his house. But the
preacher was not very hospitably treated;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3300src" href="#xd21e3300" name="xd21e3300src">72</a> and other
clues fail. There is good reason to think that Shakespeare was much
influenced by Montaigne&rsquo;s Essays, read by him in Florio&rsquo;s
translation, which was issued when he was recasting the old
<i>Hamlet</i>; and the whole treatment of life in the great tragedies
and serious comedies produced by him from that time forward is even
more definitely untheological than Montaigne&rsquo;s own
doctrine.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3306src" href="#xd21e3306" name=
"xd21e3306src">73</a> Nor can he be supposed to have disregarded the
current disputes as to fundamental beliefs, implicating as they did his
fellow-dramatists Marlowe, Kyd, and Greene. The treatise of De Mornay,
of which Sir Philip Sidney began and Arthur Golding finished the
translation,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3312src" href="#xd21e3312"
name="xd21e3312src">74</a> was in his time widely circulated in
England; and its very inadequate argumentation might well strengthen in
him the anti-theological leaning.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">A serious misconception has been set up as to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s cast of mind by the persistence of editors in
including among his works without discrimination plays which are
certainly not his, as the <i>Henry VI</i> group, to which he
contributed little, and in particular the First Part, of which he wrote
probably nothing. It is on the assumption that that play is
Shakespeare&rsquo;s work that Lecky (<i>Rationalism in Europe</i>, ed.
1887, i, 105&ndash;106) speaks of &ldquo;that melancholy picture of
Joan of Arc which is perhaps the darkest blot upon his genius.&rdquo;
Now, whatever passages Shakespeare may have contributed to the Second
and Third Parts, it is certain that he has barely a scene in the First,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>that there is not a line from his hand in the La
Pucelle scenes. Many students think that Dr. Furnivall has even gone
too far in saying that &ldquo;the only part ... to be put down to
Shakespeare is the Temple Garden scene of the red and white
roses&rdquo; (Introd. to <i>Leopold</i> Shakespeare, p. xxxviii); so
little is there to suggest even the juvenile Shakespeare there. (The
high proportion of double-endings is a ground for reckoning it a late
sample of Marlowe, who in his posthumously published translation of
Lucan had approached that proportion. Cp. the author&rsquo;s vol. on
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, p. 190.) But that any critical and qualified
reader can still hold him to have written the worst of the play is
unintelligible. The whole work would be a &ldquo;blot on his
genius&rdquo; in respect of its literary weakness. The doubt was raised
long before Lecky wrote, and was made good a generation ago. When Lecky
further proceeds, with reference to the witches in <i>Macbeth</i>, to
say (<i>id.</i> <i>note</i>) that it is &ldquo;probable that
Shakespeare ... believed with an unfaltering faith in the reality of
witchcraft,&rdquo; he strangely misreads that play. Nothing is clearer
than that it grounds Macbeth&rsquo;s action from the first in
Macbeth&rsquo;s own character and his wife&rsquo;s, employing the witch
machinery (already used by Middleton) to meet the popular taste, but
never once making the witches really causal forces. An
&ldquo;unfaltering&rdquo; believer in witchcraft who wrote for the
stage would surely have turned it to serious account in other
tragedies. This Shakespeare never does. On Lecky&rsquo;s view, he is to
be held as having believed in the fairy magic of the <i>Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream</i> and the <i>Tempest</i>, and in the actuality of
such episodes as that of the ghost in <i>Macbeth</i>. But who for a
moment supposes him to have had any such belief? It is probable that
the entire undertaking of <i>Macbeth</i> (1605?) and later of the
<i>Tempest</i> (1610?) was due to a wish on the part of the theatre
management to please King James, whose belief in witchcraft and magic
was notorious. Even the use of the Ghost in <i>Hamlet</i> is an old
stage expedient, common to the pre-Shakespearean play and to others of
Kyd&rsquo;s and Peele&rsquo;s. Shakespeare significantly altered the
dying words of Hamlet from the &ldquo;heaven receive my soul&rdquo; of
the old version to &ldquo;the rest is silence.&rdquo; The bequest of
his soul to the Deity in his will is merely the regulation testamentary
formula of the time. In his sonnets, which hint his personal cast if
anything does, there is no real trace of religious creed or feeling.
And it is clearly the hand of Fletcher, a no less sensual writer than
Peele, that penned the part of Henry VIII in which occurs the
Protestant tag: &ldquo;In her [Elizabeth&rsquo;s] days ... God shall be
truly known.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3363src" href=

</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">While, however, Shakespeare is notably naturalistic as
compared with the other Elizabethan dramatists, it remains true that
their work in the mass tells little of a habitually religious way of
thinking. Apart from the plays above named, and from polemic passages
and devotional utterances outside their plays, they hint as little of
Christian dogma as of Christian asceticism. Hence, in fact, the general
and bitter hostility of the Puritans to the stage. Even at and after
Shakespeare&rsquo;s death, the drama is substantially
&ldquo;graceless.&rdquo; Jonson, who was for a time a Catholic, but
reverted to the Church of England, disliked the Puritans, and in
<i>Bartholomew Fair</i> derides them. The age did not admit of a
pietistic drama; and when there was a powerful pietistic public, it
made an end of drama altogether. To Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign probably
belongs the <i>Atheist&rsquo;s Tragedy</i> of Cyril Tourneur, first
published in 1611, but evidently written in its author&rsquo;s early
youth&mdash;a coarse and worthless performance, full of extremely bad
imitations of Shakespeare.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3376src" href=
"#xd21e3376" name="xd21e3376src">76</a> But to the age of Elizabeth
also belongs, perhaps, the sententious tragedy of <i>Mustapha</i> by
Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, first surreptitiously published in 1609. A
century and a half later the deists were fond of quoting<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3385src" href="#xd21e3385" name=
"xd21e3385src">77</a> the concluding <i lang="la">Chorus
Sacerdotum</i>, beginning:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O wearisome condition of humanity,</p>
<p class="line xd21e3398">Born under one law, to another bound;</p>

<p class="line">If nature did not take delight in blood,</p>
<p class="line">She would have made more easy ways to good.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">It is natural to suspect that the author of such
lines was less orthodox than his own day had reputed him; and yet the
whole of his work shows him much pre-occupied with religion, though
perhaps in a deistic spirit. But Brooke&rsquo;s introspective and
undramatic poetry is an exception: the prevailing colour of the whole
drama of the Shakespearean period is pre-Puritan and semi-pagan; and
the theological spirit of the next generation, intensified by King
James, was recognized by cultured foreigners as a change for the
worse.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3411src" href="#xd21e3411" name=
"xd21e3411src">78</a> The spirit of free learning for the time was
gone, expelled by theological rancours; and when Selden ventured in his
<i>History of Tythes</i> (1618) to apply the method of dispassionate
historical criticism to ecclesiastical matters he was compelled to make
a formal retractation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3425src" href=

<p class="par">Not that rationalism became extinct. The
&ldquo;Italianate&rdquo; incredulity as to a future state, which Sir

remarkable production, which in the usual orthodox way pronounces all

mere attempt to retort upon Catholics the charge of atheism laid by
them against Protestants. Soon after, in 1605, we find Dr. John Dove
producing a <i>Confutation of Atheisme</i> in the manner of previous
continental treatises, making the word &ldquo;atheism&rdquo; cover many
shades of theism; and an essayist writing in 1608 asserts that, on
account of the self-seeking and corruption so common among churchmen,

<p class="par first">Such statements of course prove merely a frequent
coolness towards religion, not a vogue of reasoned unbelief. But the
existence of rationalizing heresy is attested by the burning of two
men, Bartholomew Legate and Edward Wightman, for avowing Unitarian
views, in 1612. These, the last executions for heresy in England, were
results of the theological zeal of King James, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>stimulated by the Calvinistic fanaticism of
Archbishop Abbot, the predecessor of Laud.</p>
<p class="par">James&rsquo;s career as a persecutor began
characteristically in a meddlesome attack upon a professor in Holland.
A German theologian of Socinian leanings, named Conrad Vorstius,
professor at Steinfurth, had produced in 1606 a somewhat heretical
treatise, <i lang="la">De Deo</i>, but had nevertheless been appointed
in 1610 professor of theology at Leyden, in succession to Arminius. It
was his acceptance of Arminian views, joined with his repute as a
scholar,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3518src" href="#xd21e3518" name=
"xd21e3518src">85</a> that secured him the invitation, which was given
without the knowledge that at a previous period he had been offered a
similar appointment by the Socinians. In his <i lang=
"la">Anti-Bellarminus contractus</i>, &ldquo;a brief refutation of the
four tomes of Bellarmin,&rdquo; he had taken the Arminian line,
repudiating the Calvinist positions which, in the opinion of Arminius,
could not be defended against the Catholic attack. But he was too
speculative and ratiocinative to be safe in an age in which the fear of
spreading Socinianism and the hate of Calvinists towards Arminianism
had set up a reign of terror. Vorstius was both
&ldquo;unsettling&rdquo; and heterodox. His opinions were &ldquo;such
as in our own day would certainly disqualify him from holding such an
office in any Christian University&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3524src" href="#xd21e3524" name="xd21e3524src">86</a> and James,
worked upon by Abbot, went so far as to make the appointment of
Vorstius a diplomatic question. The stadhouder Maurice and the bulk of
the Dutch clergy being of his view, the more tolerant statesmen of
Holland, and the mercantile aristocracy, yielded from motives of
prudence, and Vorstius was dismissed in order to save the English
alliance. Remaining thenceforth without employment, he was further
denounced in 1619 by the Synod of Dort, and banished by the States
General. Thereafter he lived for two years in hiding; and soon after
obtaining a refuge in Holstein, died, worn out by his troubles. In
England, meantime, James drew up with his own hands a catalogue of the
heresies found by him in Vorstius&rsquo;s treatise, and caused the book
to be burned in London and at the two Universities.<a class="noteref"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=

<p class="par">On the heels of this amazing episode came the cases of
Wightman and Legate. Finding, in a personal conversation, that Legate
had &ldquo;ceased to pray to Christ,&rdquo; the King had him brought
before the Bishop of London&rsquo;s Consistory Court, which sentenced
the heretic to Newgate. Being shortly released, he had the imprudence
to threaten an action for false imprisonment, whereupon he was
re-arrested. Chief Justice Coke held that, technically, the Consistory
Court could not sentence to burning; but Hobart and Bacon, the law
officers of the Crown, and other judges, were of opinion that it could.
Legate, accordingly, was duly tried, sentenced, and burned at
Smithfield; and Wightman a few days later was similarly disposed of at
Lichfield.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3562src" href="#xd21e3562" name=
"xd21e3562src">88</a></p>
<p class="par">Bacon&rsquo;s share in this matter is obscure, and has
not been discussed by either his assailants or his vindicators. As for
the general public, the historian records that &ldquo;not a word was
uttered against this horrible cruelty. As we read over the brief
contemporary notices which have reached us, we look in vain for the
slightest intimation that the death of these two men was regarded with
any other feelings than those with which the writers were accustomed to
hear of the execution of an ordinary murderer. If any remark was made,
it was in praise of James for the devotion which he showed to the cause
of God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3570src" href="#xd21e3570"
name="xd21e3570src">89</a> That might have been reckoned on. It was not
twenty years since Hamond, Lewis, Cole, and Kett had been burned on
similar grounds; and there had been no outcry then. For generations
&ldquo;direness&rdquo; had been too familiar to men&rsquo;s thoughts to
admit of their being shocked by a judicial murder or two the more.
Catholic priests had been executed by the score: why not a pair of
Unitarians?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3573src" href="#xd21e3573" name=
"xd21e3573src">90</a> Little had gone on in the average intellectual
life in the interim save religious discussion and Bibliolatry, and not
from such culture could there come any growth of human kindness or any
clearer conception of the law of reciprocity. But, whether by force of
recoil from a revival of the fires of Smithfield or from a perception
that mere cruelty did not avail to destroy heresy, the theological
<i lang="la">ultima ratio</i> was never again resorted to on English
ground.</p>
<p class="par">Though no public protest was made, the retrospective
Fuller <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>testifies that &ldquo;such burning of heretics
much startled common people, pitying all in pain, and prone to asperse
justice itself with cruelty, because of the novelty (!) and hideousness
of the punishment.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3583src" href=
"#xd21e3583" name="xd21e3583src">91</a> It is noteworthy that within a
few years of the burning of Legate and Wightman there appeared quite a
cluster of treatises explicitly contending for toleration. In 1614 came
<i>Religion&rsquo;s Peace: or, a Plea for Liberty of Conscience</i>, by
Leonard Busher, the first English book of the kind. In 1615 came
<i>Persecution for Religion Judged and Condemned</i>; and in 1620 <i>An
Humble Supplication to the King&rsquo;s Majesty</i>, pressing the same
doctrine.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3596src" href="#xd21e3596" name=
"xd21e3596src">92</a> There is no record of any outcry over these
works, though they are tolerably freespoken in their indictment of the
coercive school; and they had all to be reprinted a generation later,
their point having never been carried; but it may be surmised that
their appeal, which is substantially well reasoned from a secular as
well as from a theological point of view, had something to do with the
abandonment of persecution unto death. Even King James, in opening the
Parliament of 1614, professed to recognize that no religion or heresy
was ever extirpated by violence.</p>
<p class="par">That an age of cruel repression of heresy had promoted
unbelief is clear from the <i>Atheomastix</i> of Bishop Fotherby
(1622), which notes among other things that as a result of constant
disputing &ldquo;the Scriptures (with many) have lost their authority,
and are thought onely fit for the ignorant and idiote.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3607src" href="#xd21e3607" name=
"xd21e3607src">93</a> On this head the bishop attempts no answer; and
on his chosen theme he is perhaps the worst of all apologists. His
admission that there can be no &agrave; priori proof of deity<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3615src" href="#xd21e3615" name=
"xd21e3615src">94</a> may be counted to him for candour; but the
childishness of his reasoning &agrave; posteriori excludes the
ascription of philosophic insight. He does but use the old
pseudo-arguments of universal consent and design, with the simple
device of translating polytheistic terms into monotheistic. All the
while he makes the usual suggestions that there are few or no atheists
to convert, and these not worth converting&mdash;this at a
folio&rsquo;s length. The book tells only of difficulties evaded by
vociferation. And while the growing stress of the strife between the
ecclesiasticism of the Crown and the forces of nonconformity more and
more thrust to the front religio-political issues, there began
alongside of those strifes the new and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>powerful propaganda of
deism, which, beginning with the Latin treatise, <i lang="la">De
Veritate</i>, of Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1624), was gradually to
leaven English thought for over a century.</p>
<p class="par">Further, there now came into play the manifold influence
of <span class="sc">Francis Bacon</span>, whose case illustrates
perhaps more fully than any other the difficulties, alike external and
internal, in the way of right thinking. Taken as a whole, his work is
on account of those difficulties divided against itself, insisting as
he does alternately on a strict critical method and on the subjection
of reason to the authority of revelation. He sounds a trumpet-call to a
new and universal effort of free and circumspect intelligence; and on
the instant he stipulates for the prerogative of Scripture. Though only
one of many who assailed alike the methodic tyranny of
Aristotelianism<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3629src" href="#xd21e3629"
name="xd21e3629src">95</a> and the methodless empiricism of the
ordinary &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; thought of the past, he made his
attack with a sustained and manifold force of insight and utterance
which still entitles him to pre-eminence as the great critic of wrong
methods and the herald of better. Yet he not only transgresses often
his own principal precepts in his scientific reasoning; he falls below
several of his contemporaries and predecessors in respect of his formal
insistence on the final supremacy of theology over reason, alike in
physics and in ethics. Where Hooker is ostensibly seeking to widen the
field of rational judgment on the side of creed, Bacon, the very
champion of mental emancipation in the abstract, declares the boundary
to be fixed.</p>
<p class="par">Of those lapses from critical good faith, part of the
explanation is to be found in the innate difficulty of vital innovation
for all intelligences; part in the special pressures of the religious
environment. On the latter head Bacon makes such frequent and emphatic
protest that we are bound to infer on his part a personal experience in
his own day of the religious hostility which long followed his memory.
&ldquo;Generally,&rdquo; he wrote of himself in one fragment, &ldquo;he
perceived in men of devout simplicity this opinion, that the secrets of
nature were the secrets of God, and part of that glory whereinto the
mind of man if it seek to press shall be oppressed;... and on the other
side, in men of a devout policy he noted an inclination to have the
people depend upon God the more when they are less acquainted with
second causes, and to have no stirring in philosophy, lest it may lead
to innovation in divinity or else should discover <span class=

powers, especially in his masterpiece, the <i lang="la">Novum
Organum</i> (1620), where he comes closest to the problems of exact
inquiry, he specifies again and again both popular superstition and
orthodox theology as hindrances to scientific research, commenting on
&ldquo;those who out of faith and veneration mix their philosophy with
theology and traditions,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3653src"
href="#xd21e3653" name="xd21e3653src">98</a> and declaring that of the
drawbacks science had to contend with &ldquo;the corruption of
philosophy by superstition and an admixture of theology is far the more
widely spread, and does the greatest harm, whether to entire systems or
to their parts. For the human understanding is obnoxious to the
influence of the imagination no less than to the influence of common
notions.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3662src" href="#xd21e3662"
name="xd21e3662src">99</a> In the same passage he exclaims at the
&ldquo;extreme levity&rdquo; of those of the moderns who have attempted
to &ldquo;found a system of natural philosophy on the first chapter of
Genesis, on the book of Job, and other parts of the sacred
writings&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3667src" href="#xd21e3667"
name="xd21e3667src">100</a> and yet again, coupling as obstinate
adversaries of Natural Philosophy &ldquo;superstition, and the blind
and immoderate zeal of religion,&rdquo; he roundly affirms that
&ldquo;by the simpleness of certain divines access to any philosophy,
however pure, is well nigh closed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

by the declaration&mdash;more emphatic than those of the earlier

the nobler is the victory of faith.&rdquo;</p>

Finally, as against the formal capitulation to theology at the close of
the <i lang="la">De Augmentis</i>, he has left standing in the first
book of the Latin version the ringing doctrine of the original
<i>Advancement of Learning</i> (1605), that &ldquo;there is no power on
earth which setteth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28"

a subtle allegory in behalf of toleration.</p>
<p class="par">Thus, despite his many resorts to and prostrations
before the Scriptures, the general effect of his writings in this
regard is to set up in the minds of his readers the old
semi-rationalistic equivoque of a &ldquo;two-fold truth&rdquo;;
reminding us as they do that he &ldquo;did in the beginning separate
the divine testimony from the human.&rdquo; When, therefore, he

with his problem; and his further suggestion as to the possibility of
matter being endowed with a force of evolution, however cautiously put,
is far removed from orthodoxy. Accordingly, the charge of

solely on second causes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3834src" href=

<p class="par">As regards his intellectual inconsistencies, we can but
say that they are such as meet us in men&rsquo;s thinking at every new
turn. Though we can see that Bacon&rsquo;s orthodoxy &ldquo;doth
protest too much,&rdquo; with an eye on king and commons and public
opinion, we are not led to suppose that he had ever in his heart cast
off his inherited creed. He shows frequent Christian prejudice in his
references to pagans; and can write that &ldquo;To seek to extinguish

vanity of his co-religionists. As he was only too well aware, both
tendencies ruled the Christian thought of his own day, and derive
direct from the sacred books&mdash;not from &ldquo;abuse,&rdquo; as he
pretends. And on the metaphysical as on the common-sense side of his
thought he is self-contradictory, even as most men have been before and
since, because judgment cannot easily fulfil the precepts it frames for
itself in illuminated hours. Latter-day students have been impressed,
as was Leibnitz, by the original insight with which Bacon negated the
possibility of our forming any concrete conception of a primary form of
matter, and insisted on its necessary transcendence of our powers of
knowledge.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3914src" href="#xd21e3914" name=

normal thinking he seems to have been content with the commonplace
formula given in his essay on Atheism&mdash;that we cannot suppose the
totality of things to be &ldquo;without a mind.&rdquo; He has here
endorsed in its essentials what he elsewhere calls &ldquo;the heresy of
the Anthropomorphites,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3924src" href=

realize that similar inconsistency is fallen into after him by Spinoza,
and wholly escaped perhaps by no thinker, we are in a way to understand
that with all his deflections from his own higher law Bacon may have
profoundly and fruitfully influenced the thought of the next
generation, if not that of his own.</p>
<p class="par">The fact of this influence has been somewhat obscured by
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=

propounding his discovery of the circulation of the blood,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3981src" href="#xd21e3981" name=
"xd21e3981src">127</a> which, it is said, no physician over forty years
old at that time believed in. For the scientific men of that
century&mdash;and only among them did Copernicanism find the slightest
acceptance&mdash;it was thus no fatal shortcoming in Bacon to have
failed to grasp the true scheme of sidereal motion, any more than it
was in Galileo to be wrong about the tides and comets. They could
realize that it was precisely in astronomy, for lack of special study
and expert knowledge, that Bacon was least qualified to judge.
Intellectual influence on science is not necessarily dependent on
actual scientific achievement, though that of course furthers and
establishes it; and the fact of Bacon&rsquo;s impact on the mind of the
next age is abundantly proved by testimonies.</p>
<p class="par">For a time the explicit tributes came chiefly from
abroad; though at all times, even in the first shock of his disgrace,
there were Englishmen perfectly convinced of his greatness. To the
winning of foreign favour he had specially addressed himself in his
adversity. Grown wary in act as well as wise in theory, he deleted from
the Latin <i lang="la">De Augmentis</i> a whole series of passages of
the <i>Advancement of Learning</i> which disparaged Catholics and
Catholicism;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3995src" href="#xd21e3995"
name="xd21e3995src">128</a> and he had his reward in being appreciated
by many Jesuit and other Catholic scholars.<a class="noteref" id=

Protestants such as Comenius and Leibnitz were ere long more emphatic

that his special &ldquo;method&rdquo; enabled them to reach important
results with any new facility; its impracticability is now insisted on
by friends as well as foes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4024src" href=
"#xd21e4024" name="xd21e4024src">132</a> It was that he arraigned with
extraordinary psychological insight and brilliance of phrase the mental
vices which had made discoveries so rare; the alternate
self-complacency and despair of the average indolent mind; the
&ldquo;opinion of store&rdquo; which was &ldquo;cause of want&rdquo;;
the timid or superstitious evasion of research. In all this he was
using his own highest powers, his comprehension of human character and
his genius for speech. And though his own scientific results were not
to be compared with those of Galileo and Descartes, the wonderful range
of his observation and his curiosity, the unwearying zest of his
scrutiny of well-nigh all the known fields of Nature, must have been an
inspiration to multitudes of students besides those who have recorded
their debt to him. It is probable that but for his literary genius,
which though little discussed is of a very rare order, his influence
would have been both narrower and less durable; but, being one of the
great writers of the modern world, he has swayed men down till our own
day.</p>
<p class="par">Certain it is that alongside of his doctrine there
persisted in England, apart from all printed utterance, a movement of
deistic rationalism, of which the eighteenth century saw only the
fuller development. Sir John Suckling (1609&ndash;1641), rewriting
about 1637 his letter to the Earl of Dorset, <i>An Account of Religion
by Reason</i>, tells how in a first sketch it &ldquo;had like to have
made me an Atheist at Court,&rdquo; and how &ldquo;the fear of
Socinianism at this time renders every man that offers to give an
account of religion by reason, suspected to have none at
all&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4051src" href="#xd21e4051" name=
"xd21e4051src">133</a> but he also mentions that he knows it
&ldquo;still to be the opinion of good wits that the particular
religion of Christians has added little to the general religion of the
world.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4054src" href="#xd21e4054"
name="xd21e4054src">134</a> Himself a young man of talent, he offers
quasi-rational reconciliations of faith with reason which can have
satisfied no real doubter, and can hardly have failed to introduce

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Of popular freethought in the rest of Europe there
is little to chronicle for a hundred and fifty years after the
Reformation. The epoch-making work of <span class=
"sc">Copernicus</span>, published in 1543, had little or no immediate
effect in Germany, where, as we have seen, physical and verbal strifes
had begun with the ecclesiastical revolution, and were to continue to
waste the nation&rsquo;s energy for a century. In 1546, all attempts at
ecclesiastical reconciliation having failed, the emperor Charles V, in
whom Melanchthon had seen a model monarch,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4069src" href="#xd21e4069" name="xd21e4069src">135</a> decided to
put down the Protestant heresy by war. Luther had just died,
apprehensive for his cause. Civil war now raged till the peace of
Augsburg in 1555; whereafter Charles abdicated in favour of his son
Philip. Here were in part the conditions which in France and elsewhere
were later followed by a growth of rational unbelief; and there are
some traces even at this time of partial skepticism in high places in
the German world, notably in the case of the Emperor Maximilian II,
who, &ldquo;grown up in the spirit of doubt,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4075src" href="#xd21e4075" name="xd21e4075src">136</a> would
never identify himself with either Protestants or Catholics.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4081src" href="#xd21e4081" name=
"xd21e4081src">137</a> But in Germany there was still too little
intellectual light, too little brooding over experience, to permit of
the spread of such a temper; and the balance of forces amounted only to
a deadlock between the ecclesiastical parties. Protestantism on the
intellectual side, as already noted, had sunk into a bitter and barren
polemic<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4087src" href="#xd21e4087" name=
"xd21e4087src">138</a> among the reformers themselves; and many who had
joined the movement reverted to Catholicism.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4100src" href="#xd21e4100" name="xd21e4100src">139</a> Meanwhile
the teaching and preaching Jesuits were zealously at work, turning the
dissensions of the enemy to account, and contrasting its schism upon
schism with the unity of the Church. But Protestantism was well welded
to the financial interest of the many princes and others who had
acquired the Church lands confiscated at the Reformation; since a
return to Catholicism would mean the surrender of these.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4106src" href="#xd21e4106" name=
"xd21e4106src">140</a> Thus there wrought on the one side the organized
spirit of anti-heresy<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4112src" href=
"#xd21e4112" name="xd21e4112src">141</a> and on the other the organized
spirit of Bibliolatry, neither gaining ground; and between the two,
intellectual life was paralysed. Protestantism saw no way of advance;
and the prevailing temper began to be that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>of the
Dark Ages, expectant of the end of the world.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4125src" href="#xd21e4125" name="xd21e4125src">142</a>
Superstition abounded, especially the belief in witchcraft, now acted
on with frightful cruelty throughout the whole Christian
world;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4133src" href="#xd21e4133" name=
"xd21e4133src">143</a> and in the nature of the case Catholicism
counted for nothing on the opposite side.</p>
<p class="par">The only element of rationalism that one historian of
culture can detect is the tendency of the German moralists of the time
to turn the devil into an abstraction by identifying him with the
different aspects of human folly and vice.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4141src" href="#xd21e4141" name="xd21e4141src">144</a> There was,
as a matter of fact, a somewhat higher manifestation of the spirit of
reason in the shape of some new protests against the superstition of
sorcery. About 1560 a Catholic priest named Cornelius Loos Callidius
was imprisoned by a papal nuncio for declaring that witches&rsquo;
confessions were merely the results of torture. Forced to retract, he
was released; but again offended, and was again imprisoned, dying in
time to escape the fate of a councillor of Tr&egrave;ves, named Flade,
who was burned alive for arguing, on the basis of an old canon
(mistakenly named from the Council of Ancyra), that sorcery is an
imaginary crime.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4147src" href="#xd21e4147"
name="xd21e4147src">145</a> Such an infamy explains a great deal of the
stagnation of many Christian generations. But courage was not extinct;
and in 1563 there appeared the famous John Wier&rsquo;s treatise on
witchcraft,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4152src" href="#xd21e4152" name=
"xd21e4152src">146</a> a work which, though fully adhering to the
belief in the devil and things demoniac, argued against the notion that
witches were conscious workers of evil. Wier<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4163src" href="#xd21e4163" name="xd21e4163src">147</a> was a
physician, and saw the problem partly as one in pathology. Other
laymen, and even priests, as we have seen, had reacted still more
strongly against the prevailing insanity; but it had the authority of
Luther on its side, and with the common people the earlier protests
counted for little.</p>
<p class="par">Reactions against Protestant bigotry in Holland on other
lines were not much more successful, and indeed were not numerous. One
of the most interesting is that of <span class="sc">Dirk
Coornhert</span> (1522&ndash;1590), who by his manifold literary
activities<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4171src" href="#xd21e4171" name=
"xd21e4171src">148</a> became one of the founders of Dutch prose. In
his youth Coornhert had visited Spain <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>and Portugal, and had
there, it is said, seen an execution of victims of the
Inquisition,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4179src" href="#xd21e4179"
name="xd21e4179src">149</a> deriving thence the aversion to intolerance
which stamped his whole life&rsquo;s work. It does not appear, however,
that any such peninsular experience was required, seeing that the Dutch
Inquisition became abundantly active about the same period. Learning
Latin at thirty, in order to read Augustine, he became a translator of
Cicero and&mdash;singularly enough&mdash;of Boccaccio. An engraver to
trade, he became first notary and later secretary to the burgomaster of
Haarlem; and, failing to steer clear of the strifes of the time, was
arrested and imprisoned at the Hague in 1567. On his release he sought
safety at Kleef in Santen, whence he returned after the capture of
Brill to become secretary of the new national Government at Haarlem;
but he had again to take to flight, and lived at Kleef from 1572 to
1577. In 1578 he debated at Leyden with two preachers of Delft on
predestination, which he declared to be unscriptural; and was
officially ordered to keep silence. Thereupon he published a protest,
and got into fresh trouble by drawing up, as notary, an appeal to the
Prince of Orange on behalf of his Catholic fellow-countrymen for
freedom of worship, and by holding another debate at the
Hague.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4185src" href="#xd21e4185" name=
"xd21e4185src">150</a> Always his master-ideal was that of toleration,
in support of which he wrote strongly against Beza and Calvin (this in
a Latin treatise published only after his death), declaring the
persecution of heretics to be a crime in the kingdom of God; and it was
as a moralist that he gave the lead to Arminius on the question of
predestination.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4189src" href="#xd21e4189"
name="xd21e4189src">151</a> &ldquo;Against Protestant and Catholic
sacerdotalism and scholastic he set forth humanist world-wisdom and
Biblical ethic,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4195src" href=
"#xd21e4195" name="xd21e4195src">152</a> to that end publishing a
translation of Bo&euml;thius (1585), and composing his chief work on
<i lang="de">Zedekunst</i> (Ethics). Christianity, he insisted, lay not
in profession or creed, but in practice. By way of restraining the
ever-increasing malignity of theological strifes, he made the quaint
proposal that the clergy should not be allowed to utter anything but
the actual words of the Scriptures, and that all works of theology
should be sequestrated. For these and other heteroclite suggestions he
was expelled from Delft (where he sought finally to settle, 1587) by
the magistrates, at the instance of the preachers, but was allowed to
die in peace at Gouda, where he wrote to the last.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4201src" href="#xd21e4201" name="xd21e4201src">153</a></p>
<p class="par">All the while, though he drew for doctrine on Plutarch,
Cicero, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius equally with the
Bible, Coornhert habitually founded on the latter as the final
authority.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4223src" href="#xd21e4223" name=
"xd21e4223src">154</a> On no other footing could any one in his age and
country stand as a teacher. It was not till after generations of
furious intolerance that a larger outlook was possible in the
Netherlands; and the first steps towards it were naturally taken
independently of theology. Although Grotius figured for a century as
one of the chief exponents of Christian evidences, it is certain that
his great work on the Law of War and Peace (1625) made for a
rationalistic conception of society. &ldquo;Modern historians of
jurisprudence, like Lerminier and Bluntschli, represent it as the
distinctive merit of Grotius that he freed the science from bondage to
theology.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4226src" href="#xd21e4226"
name="xd21e4226src">155</a> The breach, indeed, is not direct, as
theistic sanctions are paraded in the Prolegomena; but along with these
goes the avowal that natural ethic would be valid even were there no
God, and&mdash;as against the formula of Horace, <i lang="la">Utilitas
justi mater</i>&mdash;that &ldquo;the mother of natural right is human
nature itself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4235src" href=
"#xd21e4235" name="xd21e4235src">156</a></p>
<p class="par">Where Grotius, defender of the faith, figured as a
heretic, unbelief could not speak out, though there are traces of its
underground life. The charge of atheism was brought against the
<i lang="la">Excercitationes Philosophic&aelig;</i> of Gorl&aelig;us,
published in 1620; but, the book being posthumous, conclusions could
not be tried. Views far short of atheism, however, were dangerous to
their holders; for the merely Socinian work of Voelkel, published at
Amsterdam in 1642, was burned by order of the authorities, and a second
impression shared the same fate.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4245src"
href="#xd21e4245" name="xd21e4245src">157</a> In 1653 the States of
Holland forbade the publication of all Unitarian books and all Socinian
worship; and though the veto as to books was soon evaded, that on
worship was enforced.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4251src" href=
"#xd21e4251" name="xd21e4251src">158</a> Still, Holland was relatively
tolerant as beside other countries; and when the Unitarian physician
Daniel Zwicker (1612&ndash;1678), of Dantzig, found his own country too
hot to hold him, he came to Holland (about 1652) &ldquo;for security
and convenience.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4254src" href=
"#xd21e4254" name="xd21e4254src">159</a> He was able to publish at
Amsterdam in 1658 his Latin <i lang="la">Irenicum Irenicorum</i>,
wherein he lays down three principles for the settlement of Christian
difficulties, the first being &ldquo;the universal reason of
mankind,&rdquo; while Scripture and tradition hold only the second and
third places. His book is a remarkable investigation of the rise of the
doctrines of the <i>Logos</i> and the Trinity, which he traced to
polytheism, making out that the first Christians, whom he identified
with the Nazarenes, regarded Jesus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"
href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>as a man. The book evoked many
answers, and it is somewhat surprising that Zwicker escaped serious
persecution, dying peacefully in Amsterdam in 1678, whereas writers
much less pronounced in their heresy incurred aggressive hostility.
Descartes, as we shall see, during his stay in Holland was menaced by
clerical fanaticism. Some fared worse. In the generation after Grotius,
one Koerbagh, a doctor, for publishing (1668) a dictionary of
definitions containing advanced ideas, had to fly from Amsterdam. At
Culenberg he translated a Unitarian work and began another; but was
betrayed, tried for blasphemy, and sentenced to ten years&rsquo;
imprisonment, to be followed by ten years&rsquo; banishment. He
compromised by dying in prison within the year. Even as late as 1678
the juri-consult Hadrian Beverland (afterwards appointed, through Isaac
Vossius, to a lay office under the Church of England) was imprisoned
and struck off the rolls of Leyden University for his <i lang=
"la">Peccatum Originale</i>, in which he speculated erotically as to
the nature of the sin of Adam and Eve. The book was furiously answered,
and publicly burned.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4272src" href=
"#xd21e4272" name="xd21e4272src">160</a> It was only after an age of
such intolerance that Holland, at the end of the seventeenth century,
began to become for England a model of freedom in opinion, as formerly
in trade. And it seems to have been through Holland, in the latter part
of the seventeenth century, that there came the fresh Unitarian impulse
which led to the considerable spread of the movement in England after
the Revolution of 1688.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4290src" href=
"#xd21e4290" name="xd21e4290src">161</a></p>
<p class="par">Unitarianism, which we have seen thus invading Holland
somewhat persistently during half a century, was then as now impotent
beyond a certain point by reason of its divided allegiance, though it
has always had the support of some good minds. Its denial of the deity
of Jesus could not be made out without a certain superposing of reason
on Scripture; and yet to Scripture it always finally appealed. The
majority of men accepting such authority have always tended to believe
more uncritically; and the majority of men who are habitually critical
will always repudiate the Scriptural jurisdiction. In Poland,
accordingly, the movement, so flourishing in its earlier years, was
soon arrested, as we have seen, by the perception that it drove many
Protestants back to Catholicism; among these being presumably a number
whose critical insight showed them that there was no firm
standing-ground between Catholicism and Naturalism. Every new advance
within the Unitarian pale <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>terrified the main body, many of whom
were mere Arians, holding by the term Trinity, and merely making the
Son subordinate to the Father. Thus when one of their most learned
ministers, Simon Budny, followed in the steps of Ferencz Davides (whom
we have seen dying in prison in Transylvania in 1579), and represented
Jesus as a &ldquo;mere&rdquo; man, he was condemned by a synod (1582)
and deposed from his office (1584). He recanted, and was
reinstated,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4300src" href="#xd21e4300" name=
"xd21e4300src">162</a> but his adherents seem to have been
excommunicated. The sect thus formed were termed Semi-Judaizers by
another heretic, Martin Czechowicz, who himself denied the
pre-existence of Jesus, and made him only a species of
demi-god;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4306src" href="#xd21e4306" name=
"xd21e4306src">163</a> yet Fausto Sozzini, better known as Faustus
Socinus, who also wrote against them, and who had worked with Biandrata
to have Davides imprisoned, conceded that prayer to Christ was
optional.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4309src" href="#xd21e4309" name=
"xd21e4309src">164</a></p>
<p class="par">Faustus, who arrived in Poland in 1579, seems to have
been moved to his strenuously &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; policy, which for
a time unified the bulk of the party, mainly by a desire to keep on
tolerable terms with Protestantism. That, however, did not serve him
with the Catholics; and when the reaction set in he suffered severely
at their hands. His treatise, <i lang="la">De Jesu Christu
Servatore</i>, created bitter resentment; and in 1598 the Catholic
rabble of Cracow, led &ldquo;as usual by the students of the
university,&rdquo; dragged him from his house. His life was saved only
by the strenuous efforts of the rector and two professors of the
university; and his library was destroyed, with his manuscripts,
whereof &ldquo;he particularly regretted a treatise which he had
composed against the atheists&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4317src" href="#xd21e4317" name="xd21e4317src">165</a> though it
is not recorded that the atheists had ever menaced either his life or
his property. He seems to have been zealous against all heresy that
outwent his own, preaching passive obedience in politics as
emphatically as any churchman, and condemning alike the rising of the
Dutch against Spanish rule and the resistance of the French Protestants
to their king.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4323src" href="#xd21e4323"
name="xd21e4323src">166</a></p>
<p class="par">This attitude may have had something to do with the
better side of the ethical doctrines of the sect, which leant
considerably to non-resistance. Czechowicz (who was deposed by his
fellow-Socinians for schism) seems not only to have preached a patient
endurance of injuries, but to have meant it;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4331src" href="#xd21e4331" name="xd21e4331src">167</a> and to the
Socinian sect belongs the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>main credit of setting up a humane
compromise on the doctrine of eternal punishment.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4336src" href="#xd21e4336" name="xd21e4336src">168</a> The time,
of course, had not come for any favourable reception of such a
compromise in Christendom; and it is noted of the German Socinian,
Ernst Schoner (Sonerus), who wrote against the orthodox dogma, that his
works are &ldquo;exceedingly scarce.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4345src" href="#xd21e4345" name="xd21e4345src">169</a>
Unitarianism as a whole, indeed, made little headway outside of Poland
and Transylvania.</p>
<p class="par">In Spain, meantime, there was no recovery from the
paralysis wrought by the combined tyranny of Church and Crown,
incarnate in the Inquisition. The monstrous multiplication of her
clergy might alone have sufficed to set up stagnation in her mental
life; but, not content with the turning of a vast multitude<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4353src" href="#xd21e4353" name=
"xd21e4353src">170</a> of men and women away from the ordinary work of
life, her rulers set themselves to expatriate as many more on the score
of heresy. A century after the expulsion of the Jews came the turn of
the Moors, whose last hold in Spain, Granada, had been overthrown in
1492. Within a generation they had been deprived of all exterior
practice of their religion;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4359src" href=
"#xd21e4359" name="xd21e4359src">171</a> but that did not suffice, and
the Inquisition never left them alone. Harried, persecuted,
compulsorily baptized, deprived of their Arabic books, they repeatedly
revolted, only to be beaten down. At length, in the opening years of
the seventeenth century (1610&ndash;1613), under Philip III, on the
score that the great Armada had failed because heretics were tolerated
at home, it was decided to expel the whole race; and now a million
Moriscoes, among the most industrious inhabitants of Spain, were driven
the way of the Jews. It is needless here to recall the ruinous effect
upon the material life of Spain:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4362src"
href="#xd21e4362" name="xd21e4362src">172</a> the aspect of the matter
which specially concerns us is the consummation of the policy of
killing out all intellectual variation. The Moriscoes may have counted
for little in positive culture; but they were one of the last and most
important factors of variation in the country; and when Spain was thus
successively denuded of precisely the most original and energetic types
among the Jewish, the Spanish, and the Moorish stocks, her mental
arrest was complete.</p>
<p class="par">To modern freethought, accordingly, she has till our own
age <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=

wrongs at Moorish hands perhaps warping his better judgment. His
humorous and otherwise kindly spirit, so incongruously neighboured,
must indeed have counted for much in keeping life sweet in Spain in the
succeeding centuries of bigotry and ignorance. But from the seventeenth
century till the other day the brains were out, in the sense that
genius was lacking. That species of variation had been too effectually
extirpated during two centuries to assert itself until after a similar
duration of normal conditions. The &ldquo;immense advantage of
religious unity,&rdquo; which even a modern Spanish historian<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4402src" href="#xd21e4402" name=
"xd21e4402src">176</a> has described as a gain balancing the economic
loss from the expulsion of the Moriscoes, was precisely the condition
of minimum intellectual activity&mdash;the unity of stagnation. No kind
of ratiocinative thought was allowed to raise its head. A Latin
translation of the <i>Hypotyposes</i> of Sextus Empiricus had been
permitted, or at least published, in Catholic France; but when Martin
Martinez de Cantatapiedra, a learned orientalist and professor of
theology, ventured to do the same thing in Spain&mdash;doubtless with
the idea of promoting faith by discouraging reason&mdash;he was haled
before the Inquisition, and the book proscribed (1583). He was further
charged with Lutheran leanings on the score that he had a preference
for the actual text of Scripture over that of the
commentators.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4414src" href="#xd21e4414"

at the death of Philip II there arose some such sense of relief
throughout Spain as was felt later in France at the death of Louis XIV;
that &ldquo;the Spaniards now ventured to sport with the chains which
they had not the power to break&rdquo;; and that Cervantes profited by
the change in conceiving and writing his Don Quixote.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4424src" href="#xd21e4424" name="xd21e4424src">179</a> But the
same historian had before seen that &ldquo;poetic freedom was
circumscribed by the same shackles which fettered moral liberty.
Thoughts which could not be expressed without fear of the dungeon and
the stake were no longer materials for the poet to work on. His
imagination, instead of improving them into poetic ideas ... had to be
taught to reject them. But the eloquence of prose was more completely
bowed down under the inquisitorial yoke than poetry, because it was
more closely allied to truth, which of all things was the most
dreaded.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4430src" href="#xd21e4430"
name="xd21e4430src">180</a> Cervantes, Lope de Vega, and Calderon
proved that within the iron wall of Catholic orthodoxy, in an age when
conclusions were but slowly being tried between dogma and reason, there
could be a vigorous play of imaginative genius on the field of human
nature; even as in Velasquez, sheltered by royal favour, the genius of
colour and portraiture could become incarnate. But after these have
passed away, the laws of social progress are revealed in the defect of
all further Spanish genius. Even of Cervantes it is recorded&mdash;on
very doubtful authority, however&mdash;that he said &ldquo;I could have
made Don Quixote much more amusing if it were not for the
Inquisition&rdquo;; and it is matter of history that a passage in his
book<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4436src" href="#xd21e4436" name=

to the faith.</p>

167. <i>Don Quixote</i> was &ldquo;always under suspicion of the
orthodox.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> p. 166. Mr. Watts, saying nothing of
Cervantes&rsquo;s approval of the expulsion of the Moriscoes, claims
that his &ldquo;head was clear of the follies and extravagances of the
reigning superstition&rdquo; (<i>id.</i> p. 231). But the case is truly
summed up by Mr. Ormsby when he says: &ldquo;For one passage capable of
being tortured into covert satire&rdquo; against things ecclesiastical,
&ldquo;there are ten in <i>Don Quixote</i> and the novels that
show&mdash;what indeed is very obvious from the little we know of his
life and character&mdash;that Cervantes was a faithful son of the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It remains to trace briefly the movement of
scientific and speculative thought which constituted the transition
between the Scholastic and the modern philosophy. It may be
compendiously noted under the names of Copernicus, Bruno, Vanini,
Galileo, Ramus, Gassendi, Bacon, and Descartes.</p>
<p class="par">The great performance of <span class=
"sc">Copernicus</span> (Nicolaus Koppernigk, 1473&ndash;1543), given to
the world with an editor&rsquo;s treacherous preface as he lay
paralysed on his deathbed, did not become a general possession for over
a hundred years. The long reluctance of its author to let it be
published, despite the express invitation of a cardinal in the name of
the pope, was well founded in his knowledge of the strength of common
prejudice; and perhaps partly in a sense of the scientific imperfection
of his own case.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4484src" href="#xd21e4484"
name="xd21e4484src">183</a> Only the special favour accorded to his
first sketch at Rome&mdash;a favour which he had further carefully
planned for in his dedicatory epistle to Pope Paul&mdash;saved his main
treatise from prohibition till long after its work was done.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4487src" href="#xd21e4487" name=
"xd21e4487src">184</a> It was in fact, with all its burden of
traditional error, the most momentous challenge that had yet been
offered in the modern world to established beliefs, alike theological
and lay, for it seemed to flout &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; as
completely as it did the cosmogony of the sacred books. It was probably
from scraps of ancient lore current in Italy in his years of youthful
study there that he first derived his idea; and in Italy none had dared
publicly to propound the geocentric theory. Its gradual victory,
therefore, is the first great modern instance of a triumph of reason
over spontaneous and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>instilled prejudice; and Galileo&rsquo;s
account of his reception of it should be a classic document in the
history of rationalism.</p>
<p class="par">It was when he was a student in his teens that there
came to Pisa one Christianus Urstitius of Rostock, a follower of
Copernicus, to lecture on the new doctrine. The young Galileo, being
satisfied that &ldquo;that opinion could be no other than a solemn
madness,&rdquo; did not attend; and those of his acquaintance who did
made a jest of the matter, all save one, &ldquo;very intelligent and
wary,&rdquo; who told him that &ldquo;the business was not altogether
to be laughed at.&rdquo; Thenceforth he began to inquire of
Copernicans, with the result inevitable to such a mind as his.
&ldquo;Of as many as I examined I found not so much as one who told me
not that he had been a long time of the contrary opinion, but to have
changed it for this, as convinced by the strength of the reasons
proving the same; and afterwards questioning them one by one, to see
whether they were well possessed of the reasons of the other side, I
found them all to be very ready and perfect in them, so that I could
not truly say that they took this opinion out of ignorance, vanity, or
to show the acuteness of their wits.&rdquo; On the other hand, the
opposing Aristoteleans and Ptolemeans had seldom even superficially
studied the Copernican system, and had in no case been converted from
it. &ldquo;Whereupon, considering that there was no man who followed
the opinion of Copernicus that had not been first on the contrary side,
and that was not very well acquainted with the reasons of Aristotle and
Ptolemy, while, on the contrary, there was not one of the followers of
Ptolemy that had ever been of the judgment of Copernicus, and had left
that to embrace this of Aristotle,&rdquo; he began to realize how
strong must be the reasons that thus drew men away from beliefs
&ldquo;imbibed with their milk.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4494src" href="#xd21e4494" name="xd21e4494src">185</a> We can
divine how slow would be the progress of a doctrine which could only
thus begin to find its way into one of the most gifted scientific minds
of the modern world. It was only a minority of the <i lang=
"fr">&eacute;lite</i> of the intellectual life who could receive it,
even after the lapse of a hundred years.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The doctrine of the earth&rsquo;s two-fold motion,
as we have seen, had actually been taught in the fifteenth century by
Nicolaus of Cusa (1401&ndash;1464), who, instead of being prosecuted,
was made a cardinal, so little was the question then considered
(Ueberweg, ii, 23&ndash;24). See above, vol. i, p. 368, as to Pulci.
Only very slowly did the work even of Copernicus make its impression.
Green (<i>Short History</i>, ed. 1881, p. 297) makes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>first
the mistake of stating that it influenced thought in the
<i>fifteenth</i> century, and then the further mistake of saying that
it was brought home to the general intelligence by Galileo and Kepler
in the later years of the <i>sixteenth</i> century (<i>id.</i> p. 412).
Galileo&rsquo;s European notoriety dates from 1616; his <i>Dialogues of
the Two Systems of the World</i> appeared only in 1632; and his
<i>Dialogues of the New Sciences</i> in 1638. Kepler&rsquo;s indecisive
<i lang="la">Mysterium Cosmographicum</i> appeared only in 1597; his
treatise on the motions of the planet Mars not till 1609.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">One of the first to bring the new cosmological
conception to bear on philosophic thought was <span class="sc">Giordano
Bruno</span> of Nola (1548&ndash;1600), whose life and death of lonely
chivalry have won him his place as the typical martyr of modern
freethought.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4539src" href="#xd21e4539"
name="xd21e4539src">186</a> He may be conceived as a blending of the
pantheistic and naturalistic lore of ancient Greece,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4592src" href="#xd21e4592" name="xd21e4592src">187</a>
assimilated through the Florentine Platonists, with the spirit of
modern science (itself a revival of the Greek) as it first takes firm
form in Copernicus, whose doctrine Bruno early and ardently embraced.
Baptized Filippo, he took Giordano as his cloister-name when he entered
the great convent of S. Domenico Maggiore at Naples in 1563, in his
fifteenth year. No human being was ever more unfitly placed among the
Dominicans, punningly named the &ldquo;hounds of the Lord&rdquo;
(<i lang="la">domini canes</i>) for their work as the corps of the
Inquisition; and very early in his cloister life he came near being
formally proceeded against for showing disregard of sacred images, and
making light of the sanctity of the Virgin.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4601src" href="#xd21e4601" name="xd21e4601src">188</a> He passed
his novitiate, however, without further trouble, and was fully ordained
a priest in 1572, in his twenty-fourth year. Passing then through
several Neapolitan monasteries during a period of three years, he seems
to have become not a little of a freethinker on his return to his first
cloister, as he had already reached Arian opinions in regard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>to Christ, and soon proceeded to substitute a
mystical and Pythagorean for the orthodox view of the Trinity.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4610src" href="#xd21e4610" name=
"xd21e4610src">189</a></p>
<p class="par">For the second time a &ldquo;process&rdquo; was begun
against him, and he took flight to Rome (1576), presenting himself at a
convent of his Order. News speedily came from Naples of the process
against him, and of the discovery that he had possessed a volume of the
works of Chrysostom and Jerome with the scholia of Erasmus&mdash;a
prohibited thing. Only a few months before Bartolomeo Carranza, Bishop
of Toledo, who had won the praise of the Council of Trent for his index
of prohibited books, had been condemned to abjure for the doctrine that
&ldquo;the worship of the relics of the saints is of human
institution,&rdquo; and had died in the same year at the convent to
which Bruno had now gone. Thus doubly warned, he threw off his priestly
habit, and fled to the Genoese territory,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4615src" href="#xd21e4615" name="xd21e4615src">190</a> where, in
the commune of Noli, he taught grammar and astronomy. In 1578 he
visited successively Turin, Venice, Padua, Bergamo, and Milan, resuming
at the last-named town his monk&rsquo;s habit. Thereafter he again
returned to Turin, passing thence to Chamb&eacute;ry at the end of
1578, and thence to Geneva early in 1579.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4618src" href="#xd21e4618" name="xd21e4618src">191</a> His wish,
he said, was &ldquo;to live in liberty and security&rdquo;; but for
that he must first renounce his Dominican habit; other Italian
refugees, of whom there were many at Geneva, helping him to a
layman&rsquo;s suit. Becoming a corrector of the press, he seems to
have conformed externally to Calvinism; but after a stay of two and
a-half months he published a short diatribe against one Antonio de La
Faye, who professed philosophy at the Academy; and for this he was
arrested and sentenced to excommunication, while his bookseller was
subjected to one day&rsquo;s imprisonment and a fine.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4621src" href="#xd21e4621" name="xd21e4621src">192</a> After
three weeks the excommunication was raised; but he nevertheless left
Geneva, and afterwards spoke of Calvinism as the &ldquo;<i>de</i>formed
religion.&rdquo; After a few weeks&rsquo; sojourn at Lyons he went to
Toulouse, the very centre of inquisitional orthodoxy; and there,
strangely enough, he was able to stay for more than a year,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4638src" href="#xd21e4638" name=
"xd21e4638src">193</a> taking his degree as Master of Arts and becoming
professor of astronomy. But the civil wars made Toulouse unsafe; and at
length, probably in 1581 or 1582, he reached Paris, where for a time he
lectured as professor extraordinary.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4642src" href="#xd21e4642" name="xd21e4642src">194</a> In 1583 he
reached England, where he remained till <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>1585, lecturing, debating
at Oxford on the Copernican theory, and publishing a number of his
works, four of them dedicated to his patron Castelnau de
Mauvissi&egrave;re, the French ambassador. Oxford was then a stronghold
of bigoted Aristotelianism, where bachelors and masters deviating from
<i>the</i> master were fined, or, if openly hostile, expelled.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4650src" href="#xd21e4650" name=
"xd21e4650src">195</a> In that camp Bruno was not welcome. But he had
other shelter, at the French Embassy in London, and there he had
notable acquaintances. He had met Sir Philip Sidney at Milan in 1578;
and his dialogue, <i lang="it">Cena de le Ceneri</i>, gives a vivid
account of a discussion in which he took a leading part at a banquet
given by Sir Fulke Greville. His picture of &ldquo;Oxford ignorance and
English ill-manners&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4659src" href=
"#xd21e4659" name="xd21e4659src">196</a> is not lenient; and there is
no reason to suppose that his doctrine was then assimilated by
many;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4669src" href="#xd21e4669" name=
"xd21e4669src">197</a> but his stay in the household of Castelnau was
one of the happiest periods of his chequered life. While in England he
wrote no fewer than seven works, four of them dedicated to Castelnau,
and two&mdash;the <i>Heroic Fervours</i> and the <i>Expulsion of the
Triumphant Beast</i>&mdash;to Sir Philip Sidney.</p>
<p class="par">Returning to Paris on the recall of Castelnau in 1585,
he made an attempt to reconcile himself to the Church, but it was
fruitless; and thereafter he went his own way. After a public
disputation at the university in 1586, he set out on a new
peregrination, visiting first Mayence, Marburg, and Wittemberg. At
Marburg he was refused leave to debate; and at Wittemberg he seems to
have been carefully conciliatory, as he not only matriculated but
taught for over a year (1586&ndash;1588), till the Calvinist party
carried the day over the Lutheran.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4699src"
href="#xd21e4699" name="xd21e4699src">198</a> Thereafter he reached
Prague, Helmstadt, Frankfort, and Zurich. At length, on the fatal
invitation of the Venetian youth Mocenigo, he re-entered Italian
territory, where, in Venice, he was betrayed to the Inquisition by his
treacherous and worthless pupil.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4702src"
href="#xd21e4702" name="xd21e4702src">199</a></p>
<p class="par">What had been done for freethought by Bruno in his
fourteen years of wandering, debating, and teaching through Europe it
is impossible to estimate; but it is safe to say that he was one of the
most powerful antagonists to orthodox unreason that had yet
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>appeared. Of all men of his time he had perhaps
the least affinity with the Christian creed, which was repellent to him
alike in the Catholic and the Protestant versions. The attempt to prove
him a believer on the strength of a non-autograph manuscript<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4714src" href="#xd21e4714" name=
"xd21e4714src">200</a> is idle. His approbation of a religion for the
discipline of uncivilized peoples is put in terms of unbelief.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4717src" href="#xd21e4717" name=
"xd21e4717src">201</a> In the <i lang="it">Spaccio della bestia
trionfante</i> he derides the notion of a union of divine and human
natures, and substantially proclaims a natural (theistic) religion,
negating all &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; religions alike. Where Boccaccio
had accredited all the three leading religions, Bruno disallows all
with paganism, though he puts that above Christianity.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4731src" href="#xd21e4731" name=
"xd21e4731src">202</a> And his disbelief grew more stringent with his
years. Among the heretical propositions charged against him by the
Inquisition were these: that there is transmigration of souls; that
magic is right and proper; that the Holy Spirit is the same thing as
the soul of the world; that the world is eternal; that Moses, like the
Egyptians, wrought miracles by magic; that the sacred writings are but
a romance (<i lang="it">sogno</i>); that the devil will be saved; that
only the Hebrews are descended from Adam, other men having descended
from progenitors created by God before Adam; that Christ was not God,
but was a notorious sorcerer (<i lang="la">insigne mago</i>), who,
having deceived men, was deservedly hanged, not crucified; that the
prophets and the apostles were bad men and sorcerers, and that many of
them were hanged as such. The cruder of these propositions rest solely
on the allegation of Mocenigo, and were warmly repudiated by Bruno:
others are professedly drawn, always, of course, by forcing his
language, but not without some colourable pretext, from his two
&ldquo;poems,&rdquo; <i lang="la">De triplice, minimo, et mensura</i>,
and <i lang="la">De monade, numero et figura</i>, published at
Frankfort in 1591, in the last year of his freedom.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4753src" href="#xd21e4753" name="xd21e4753src">203</a> But the
allusions in the <i lang="la">Sigillus Sigillorum</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4759src" href="#xd21e4759" name="xd21e4759src">204</a> to the
weeping worship of a suffering Adonis, to the exhibition of suffering
and miserable Gods, to transpierced divinities, and to sham miracles,
were certainly intended to contemn the Christian system.</p>
<p class="par">Alike in the details of his propaganda and in the temper
of his utterance, Bruno expresses from first to last the spirit of
freethought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>and free speech. <i lang="la">Libertas
philosophica</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4776src" href="#xd21e4776"
name="xd21e4776src">205</a> is the breath of his nostrils; and by his
life and his death alike he upholds the ideal for men as no other
before him did. The wariness of Rabelais and the non-committal
skepticism of Montaigne are alike alien to him; he is too lacking in
reticence, too explosive, to give due heed even to the common-sense
amenities of life, much more to hedge his meaning with safeguarding
qualifications. And it was doubtless as much by the contagion of his
mood as by his lore that he impressed men.</p>
<p class="par">His personal and literary influence was probably most
powerful in respect of his eager propaganda of the Copernican doctrine,
which he of his own force vitally expanded and made part of a
pantheistic conception of the universe.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4787src" href="#xd21e4787" name="xd21e4787src">206</a> Where
Copernicus adhered by implication to the idea of an external and
limitary sphere&mdash;the last of the eight of the Ptolemaic
theory&mdash;Bruno reverted boldly to the doctrine of Anaximandros, and
declared firmly for the infinity of space and of the series of the
worlds. In regard to biology he makes an equivalent advance, starting
from the thought of Empedocles and Lucretius, and substituting an idea
of natural selection for that of creative providence.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4801src" href="#xd21e4801" name="xd21e4801src">207</a> The
conception is definitely thought out, and marks him as one of the
renovators of scientific no less than of philosophic thought for the
modern world; though the special paralysis of science under Christian
theology kept his ideas on this side pretty much a dead letter for his
own day. And indeed it was to the universal and not the particular that
his thought chiefly and most enthusiastically turned. A philosophic
poet rather than a philosopher or man of science, he yet set abroad for
the modern world that conception of the physical infinity of the
universe which, once psychologically assimilated, makes an end of the
medieval theory of things. On this head he was eagerly affirmative; and
the merely Pyrrhonic skeptics he assailed as he did the
&ldquo;asinine&rdquo; orthodox, though he insisted on doubt as the
beginning of wisdom.</p>
<p class="par">Of his extensive literary output not much is stamped
with lasting scientific fitness or literary charm; and some of his
treatises, as those on mnemonics, have no more value than the product
of his didactic model, Raymond Lully. As a writer he is at his best in
the sweeping expatiation of his more general philosophic treatises,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>where he attains a lifting ardour of inspiration,
a fervour of soaring outlook, that puts him in the front rank of the
thinkers of his age. And if his literary character is at times open to
severe criticism in respect of his lack of balance, sobriety, and
self-command, his final courage atones for such shortcomings.</p>
<p class="par">His case, indeed, serves to remind us that at certain
junctures it is only the unbalanced types that aid humanity&rsquo;s
advance. The perfectly prudent and self-sufficing man does not achieve
revolutions, does not revolt against tyrannies; he wisely adapts
himself and subsists, letting the evil prevail as it may. It is the
more impatient and unreticent, the eager and hot-brained&mdash;in a
word, the faulty&mdash;who clash with oppression and break a way for
quieter spirits through the hedges of enthroned authority. The serenely
contemplative spirit is rather a possession than a possessor for his
fellows; he may inform and enlighten, but is not in himself a
countering or inspiriting force: a Shelley avails more than a Goethe
against tyrannous power. And it may be that the battling enthusiast in
his own way wins liberation for himself from &ldquo;fear of fortune and
death,&rdquo; as he wins for others liberty of action.<a class=

griefs and taking stripes that they might be kept whole, was Bruno.</p>
<p class="par">And though he quailed at the first shock of capture and
torture, when the end came he vindicated human nature as worthily as
could any quietist. It was a long-drawn test. Charged on the

denied them all,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4827src" href="#xd21e4827"

<p class="par">What is historically certain is that Bruno was not
released, but sent on to Rome, and was kept there in prison for seven
years. He was not the sort of heretic likely to be released; though the
fact of his being a Dominican, and the desire to maintain the
Church&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=

execution. Certainly not an atheist (he called himself in several of

not professedly anti-Christian in his view of the universe. If the
Church had cause to fear any philosophic teaching, it was his, preached
with the ardour of a prophet and the eloquence of a poet. His doctrine
that the worlds in space are innumerable was as offensive to orthodox
ears as his specific negations of Christian dogma, outgoing as it did
the later idea of Kepler and Galileo. He had, moreover, finally refused
to make any fresh recantation; and the only detailed document extant
concerning his final trial describes him as saying to his judges:
&ldquo;With more fear, perchance, do you pass sentence on me than I
receive it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4874src" href=

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">An attempt has been made by Professor Desdouits in
a pamphlet (<i lang="fr">La l&eacute;gende tragique de Jordano
Bruno</i>; Paris, 1885) to show that there is no evidence that Bruno
was burned; and an anonymous writer in the <i>Scottish Review</i>
(October, 1888, Art. II), rabidly hostile to Bruno, has maintained the
same proposition. Doubt on the subject dates from Bayle. Its main
ground is the fewness of the documentary records, of which, further,
the genuineness is now called in question. But no good reason is shown
for doubting them. They are three.</p>
<p class="par">1. The Latin letter of Gaspar Schopp (Scioppius), dated
February 17, 1600, is an eye-witness&rsquo;s account of the sentencing
and burning of Bruno at that date. (See it in full, in the original
Latin, in Berti, p. 461 <i>sq.</i>, and in App. V to Frith, <i>Life
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>of Bruno</i>, and partly translated in Prof.
Adamson&rsquo;s lectures, as cited. It was rep. by Struvius in his
<i lang="la">Acta Literaria</i>, tom. v, and by La Croze in his
<i lang="fr">Entretiens sur divers sujets</i> in 1711, p. 287.) It was
not printed till 1621, but the grounds urged for its rejection are
totally inadequate, and involve assumptions, which are themselves
entirely unproved, as to what Scioppius was likely to do. Finally, no
intelligible reason is suggested for the forging of such a document.
The remarks of Prof. Desdouits on this head have no force whatever. The
writer in the <i>Scottish Review</i> (p. 263, and <i>note</i>) suggests
as &ldquo;at least as possible an hypothesis as any other that he
[Bruno] was the author of the forged accounts of his own death.&rdquo;
Comment is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="par">2. There are preserved two extracts from Roman
news-letters (<i lang="it">Avvisi</i>) of the time; one, dated February
12, 1600, commenting on the case; the other, dated February 19,
relating the execution on the 17th. (See both in <i>S. R.</i>, pp.
264&ndash;65. They were first printed by Berti in <i lang=
"it">Documenti intorno a Giordano Bruno</i>, Rome, 1880, and are
reprinted in his <i>Vita</i>, ed. 1889, cap. xix; also by Levi, as
cited.) Against these testimonies the sole plea is that they mis-state
Bruno&rsquo;s opinions and the duration of his imprisonment&mdash;a
test which would reduce to mythology the contents of most newspapers in
our own day. The writer in the <i>Scottish Review</i> makes the
suicidal suggestion that, inasmuch as the errors as to dates occur in
Schopp&rsquo;s letter, &ldquo;the so-called Schopp was fabricated from
these notices, or they from Schopp&rdquo;&mdash;thus admitting one to
be historical.</p>
<p class="par">3. There has been found, by a Catholic investigator, a
double entry in the books of the Lay Brotherhood of <i lang="it">San
Giovanni Decollato</i>, whose function was to minister to prisoners
under capital sentence, giving a circumstantial account of
Bruno&rsquo;s execution. (See it in <i>S. R.</i>, pp. 266, 269, 270.)
In this case, the main entry being dated &ldquo;1600. Thursday.
February 16th,&rdquo; the anonymous writer argues that &ldquo;the whole
thing resolves itself into a make-up,&rdquo; because February 16 was
the Wednesday. The entry refers to the procedure of the Wednesday night
and the Thursday morning; and such an error could easily occur in any
case. Whatever may be one day proved, the cavils thus far count for
nothing. All the while, the records as to Bruno remain in the hands of
the Catholic authorities; but, despite the discredit constantly cast on
the Church on the score of Bruno&rsquo;s execution, they offer no
official denial of the common statement; while they do officially admit
(<i>S. R.</i>, p. 252) that on February 8 Bruno was sentenced as an
&ldquo;obstinate heretic,&rdquo; and &ldquo;given over to the Secular
Court.&rdquo; On the other hand, the episode is well vouched; and the
argument from the silence of ambassadors&rsquo; letters is so far void.
No pretence is made of tracing Bruno anywhere after February, 1600.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Since the foregoing note appeared in the first edition I
have met with the essay of Mr. R. Copley Christie, &ldquo;Was Giordano
Bruno Really Burned?&rdquo; (<i>Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,
October, 1885; rep. in Mr. Christie&rsquo;s <i>Selected Essays and
Papers</i>, 1902). This is a crushing answer to the thesis of M.
Desdouits, showing as it does clear grounds not only for affirming the
genuineness of the letter of Scioppius, but for doubting the diligence
of M. Desdouits. Mr. Christie points out (1) that in his book
<i>Ecclesiasticus</i>, printed in 1612, Scioppius refers to the burning
of Bruno almost in the words of his letter of 1600; (2) that in 1607
Kepler wrote to a correspondent of the burning of Bruno, giving as his
authority J. M. Wacker, who in 1600 was living at Rome as the imperial
ambassador; and (3) that the tract <i lang="it">Machiavellizatio</i>,
1621, in which the letter of Scioppius was first printed, was well
known in its day, being placed on the <i>Index</i>, and answered by two
writers without eliciting any repudiation from Scioppius, who lived
till 1649. As M. Desdouits staked his case on the absence of allusion
to the subject before 1661 (overlooking even the allusion by Mersenne,
in 1624, cited by Bayle), his theory may be taken as exploded.</p>

freethought, also an Italian (b. at Taurisano, 1585), is open to the
more relevant charges of an inordinate vanity and some duplicity.
Figuring as a Carmelite friar, which he was not, he came to England

contriving to be reconciled to the Church, after being imprisoned for
forty-nine days on an unrecorded charge. Previously he had figured,
like Bruno, as a wandering scholar at Amsterdam, Brussels, Cologne,
Geneva, and Lyons; and afterwards he taught natural philosophy for a
year at Genoa. His treatise, <i lang="la">Amphitheatrum &AElig;terna
Providenti&aelig;</i> (Lyons, 1615), is professedly directed against
&ldquo;ancient philosophers, Atheists, Epicureans, Peripatetics, and

name="xd21e5044src">226</a> while showing a freer critical spirit,
would seem to be in part earlier in composition, if we can trust the

various quarters, and published only with the reluctant consent of the
author.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5049src" href="#xd21e5049" name=

agree. Yet he was convicted, by the voices of the majority, and burned
alive (February 9, 1619) on the day of his sentence. Drawn on a hurdle,
in his shirt, with a placard on his shoulders inscribed &ldquo;Atheist

imprudent, and ill-balanced. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href=

vindication of orthodoxy, we may infer from the <i lang="la">De
Arcanis</i> that the arguments of these skeptics, like those of the
contemporary atheists whom he had met in his travels, had kept their
hold on his thought even while he controverted them. For it cannot be
disputed that the long passages which he quotes from the &ldquo;atheist
at Amsterdam&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5218src" href=
"#xd21e5218" name="xd21e5218src">243</a> are put with a zest and
cogency which are not infused into the professed rebuttals, and are in
themselves quite enough to arouse the anger and suspicion of a pious
reader. A writer who set forth so fully the acute arguments of
unbelievers, unprintable by their authors, might well be suspected of
writing at Christianity when he confuted the creeds of the pagans. As
was noted later of Fontenelle, he put arguments against oracles which
endangered prophecy; his dismissal of sorcery as the dream of troubled
brains appeals to reason and not to faith; and his disparagement of
pagan miracles logically bore upon the Christian.</p>
<p class="par">When he comes to the question of immortality he grows
overtly irreverent. Asked by the interlocutor in the last dialogue to
give his views on the immortality of the soul, he begs to be excused,
protesting: &ldquo;I have vowed to my God that that question shall not
be handled by me till I become old, rich, and a German.&rdquo; And
without overt irreverence he is ever and again unserious. Perfectly
transparent is the irony of the appeal, &ldquo;Let us give faith to the
prescripts of the Church, and due honour to the sacrosanct Gregorian
apparitions,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5228src" href=
"#xd21e5228" name="xd21e5228src">244</a> and the protestation, &ldquo;I

for the attack,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5237src" href="#xd21e5237"
name="xd21e5237src">246</a> and a notable disposition to rely finally
on lines of argument to which faith could never give real welcome. The
writer&rsquo;s mind, it is clear, was familiar with doubt. <span class=

and an <i lang="la">Apologia pro concilio Tridentino</i>, he can be
seen even in the hymn to deity with which he concludes his <i lang=
"la">Amphitheatrum</i> to have no part in evangelical Christianity.</p>
<p class="par">He was in fact a deist with the inevitable leaning of
the philosophic theist to pantheism; and whatever he may have said to
arouse priestly hatred at Toulouse, he was rather less of an atheist
than Spinoza or Bruno or John Scotus. On his trial,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5266src" href="#xd21e5266" name="xd21e5266src">248</a> pressed
as to his real beliefs by judges who had doubtless challenged his
identification of God with Nature, he passed from a profession of
orthodox faith in a trinity into a flowing discourse which could as
well have availed for a vindication of pantheism as for the proposition
of a personal God. Seeing a straw on the ground, he picked it up and
talked of its history; and when brought back again from his affirmation
of Deity to his doctrine of Nature, he set forth the familiar orthodox
theorem that, while Nature wrought the succession of seeds and fruits,
there must have been a first seed which was created. It was the
habitual standing ground of theism; and they burned him all the same.
It remains an open question whether personal enmity on the part of the
prosecuting official<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5269src" href=
"#xd21e5269" name="xd21e5269src">249</a> or a real belief that he had
uttered blasphemies against Jesus or Mary was the determining force, or
whether even less motive sufficed. A vituperative Jesuit of that age
sees intolerable freethinking in his suggestion of the unreality of
demoniacal possession and the futility of exorcisms.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5272src" href="#xd21e5272" name="xd21e5272src">250</a> And for
that much they were not incapable of burning men in Catholic Toulouse

<p class="par">There are in fact reasons for surmizing that in the
cases alike of Bruno and of Vanini it was the attitude of the
speculator towards scientific problems that primarily or mainly aroused
distrust and anger among the theologians. Vanini is careful to speak
equivocally of the eternity of the universe; and though he makes a
passing mention of Kepler,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5280src" href=

"xd21e5287src" href="#xd21e5287" name="xd21e5287src">252</a> he
declares so explicitly for a naturalistic explanation of the movements
of the heavenly bodies that he must have aroused in some orthodox
readers such anger as was set up in Plato <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

sun and stars. After an &agrave; priori discussion on Aristotelian
lines, the querist in the dialogue asks what may fitly be held, with an
eye to religion, concerning the movements of the spheres.
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; answers Vanini, &ldquo;unless I am in error: the
mass of the heaven is moved in its proper gyratory way by the nature of
its elements.&rdquo; &ldquo;How then,&rdquo; asks the querist,
&ldquo;are the heavens moved by certain and fixed laws, unless divine
minds, participating in the primal motion, there operate?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Where is the wonder?&rdquo; returns Vanini. &ldquo;Does not a
certain and fixed law of motion act in the most paltry clockwork
machines, made by a drunken German, even as there works silently in a
tertian and quartan fever a motion which comes and goes at fixed
periods without <span class="corr" id="xd21e5292" title=
"Source: trangressing">transgressing</span> its line by a moment? The
sea also at certain and fixed times, by its nature, as you peripatetics
affirm, is moved in progressions and regressions. No less, then, I
affirm the heaven to be forever carried by the same motion in virtue of
its nature (<i lang="la">a sua pura forma</i>) and not to be moved by
the will of intelligence.&rdquo; And the disciple assents. Kepler had
seen fit, either in sincerity or of prudence, to leave &ldquo;divine
minds&rdquo; in the planets; and Vanini&rsquo;s negation, though not
accompanied by any assertion of the motion of the earth, was enough to
provoke the minds which had only three years before put Copernicus on
the <i>Index</i>, and challenged Galileo for venting his doctrine.</p>
<p class="par">It is at this stage that we begin to realize the full
play of the Counter-Reformation, as against the spirit of science. The
movement of mere theological and ecclesiastical heresy had visibly
begun to recede in the world of mind, and in its stead, alike in
Protestant and in Catholic lands, there was emerging a new activity of
scientific research, vaguely menacing to all theistic faith. Kepler
represented it in Germany, Harriott and Harvey and Gilbert and Bacon in
England; from Italy had come of late the portents of Bruno and Galileo;
even Spain yielded the <i lang="es">Examen de Ingenios</i> of Huarte
(1575), where with due protestation of theism the physicist insists
upon natural causation; and now Vanini was exhibiting the same
incorrigible zest for a naturalistic explanation of all things. His
dialogues are full of such questionings; the mere metaphysic and
theosophy of the <i lang="la">Amphitheatrum</i> are being superseded by
discussions on physical and physiological phenomena. It was for this,
doubtless, that the <i lang="la">De Arcanis</i> won the special vogue
over which the Jesuit Garasse was angrily exclaiming ten years
later.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5313src" href="#xd21e5313" name=
"xd21e5313src">253</a> Not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>merely the doubts cast upon sorcery
and diabolical possession, but the whole drift, often enough erratic,
of the inquiry as to how things in nature came about, caught the
curiosity of the time, soon to be stimulated by more potent and
better-governed minds than that of the ill-starred Vanini. And for
every new inquirer there would be a hostile zealot in the Church, where
the anti-intellectual instinct was now so much more potent than it had
been in the days before Luther, when heresy was diagnosed only as a
danger to revenue.</p>
<p class="par">It was with <span class="sc">Galileo</span> that there
began the practical application of the Copernican theory to astronomy,
and, indeed, the decisive demonstration of its truth. With him,
accordingly, began the positive rejection of the Copernican theory by
the Church; for thus far it had never been officially
vetoed&mdash;having indeed been generally treated as a wild absurdity.
Almost immediately after the publication of Galileo&rsquo;s <i lang=
"la">Sidereus Nuncius</i> (1610) his name is found in the papers of the
Inquisition, with that of Cremonini of Padua, as a subject of
investigation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5329src" href="#xd21e5329"
name="xd21e5329src">254</a> The juxtaposition is noteworthy. Cremonini
was an Aristotelian, with Averro&iuml;st leanings, and reputed an
atheist;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5335src" href="#xd21e5335" name=
"xd21e5335src">255</a> and it was presumably on this score that the
Inquisition was looking into his case. At the same time, as an
Aristotelian he was strongly opposed to Galileo, and is said to have
been one of those who refused to look through Galileo&rsquo;s
telescope.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5347src" href="#xd21e5347" name=
"xd21e5347src">256</a> Galileo, on the other hand, was ostensibly a
good Catholic; but his discovery of the moons of Jupiter was a signal
confirmation of the Copernican theory, and the new status at once given
to that made a corresponding commotion in the Church. Thus he had
against him both the unbelieving pedants of the schools and the typical
priests.</p>
<p class="par">In his book the great discoverer had said nothing
explicitly on the subject of the Copernican theory; but in lectures and
conversations he had freely avowed his belief in it; and the
implications of the published treatise were clear to all
thinkers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5358src" href="#xd21e5358" name=
"xd21e5358src">257</a> And though, when he visited Rome in 1611, he was
well received by Pope Paul V, and his discoveries were favourably
reported of by the four scientific experts nominated at the request of
Cardinal Bellarmin to examine them,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5364src"
href="#xd21e5364" name="xd21e5364src">258</a> it only needed that the
Biblical cry should be raised to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58"

still contained men individually open to new scientific ideas; but she
was then more than ever dominated by the forces of tradition; and as
soon as those forces had been practically evoked his prosecution was
bound to follow. The cry of &ldquo;religion in danger&rdquo; silenced
the saner men at Rome.</p>
<p class="par">The fashion in which Galileo&rsquo;s sidereal
discoveries were met is indeed typical of the whole history of
freethought. The clergy pointed to the story of Joshua stopping the sun
and moon; the average layman scouted the new theory as plain folly; and
typical schoolmen insisted that &ldquo;the heavens are
unchangeable,&rdquo; and that there was no authority in Aristotle for
the new assertions. With such minds the man of science had to argue,
and in deference to such he had at length to affect to doubt his own
demonstrations.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5373src" href="#xd21e5373"
name="xd21e5373src">259</a> The Catholic Reaction had finally created
as bitter a spirit of hostility to free science in the Church as
existed among the Protestants; and in Italy even those who saw the
moons of Jupiter through his telescope dared not avow what they had
seen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5382src" href="#xd21e5382" name=
"xd21e5382src">260</a> It was therefore an unfortunate step on
Galileo&rsquo;s part to go from Padua, which was under the rule of
Venice, then anti-papal,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5385src" href=
"#xd21e5385" name="xd21e5385src">261</a> to Tuscany, on the invitation
of the Grand Duke. When in 1613 he published his treatise on the solar
spots, definitely upholding Copernicus against Jesuits and
Aristotelians, trouble became inevitable; and his letter<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5388src" href="#xd21e5388" name=
"xd21e5388src">262</a> to his pupil, Father Castelli, professor of
mathematics at Pisa, discussing the Biblical argument with which they
had both been met, at once evoked an explosion when circulated by
Castelli. New trouble arose when Galileo in 1615 wrote his apology in
the form of a letter to his patroness the Dowager Grand Duchess
Cristina of Tuscany, extracts from which became current. An outcry of
ignorant Dominican monks<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5394src" href=
"#xd21e5394" name="xd21e5394src">263</a> sufficed to set at work the

href="#xd21e5404" name="xd21e5404src">264</a> the first result of which
(1616) was to put on the list of condemned books the great treatise of
Copernicus, published seventy-three years before. Galileo personally
escaped for the present through the friendly intervention of the Pope,
Paul V, on the appeal of his patron, the Grand Duke of Tuscany,
apparently on the ground that he had not publicly taught the Copernican
theory. It would seem <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"

heart Copernicans;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5409src" href=
"#xd21e5409" name="xd21e5409src">265</a> but they were in any case
obliged to disown a doctrine felt by so many others to be subversive of
the Church&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">See the details of the procedure in Domenico
Berti, <i lang="it">Il Processo Originale de Galileo Galilei</i>, ed.
1878, cap. iv; in Fahie, ch. viii; and in Gebler, ch. vi. The
last-cited writer claims to show that, of two records of the
&ldquo;admonition&rdquo; to Galileo, one, the more stringent in its
terms, was false, <i>though made at the date it bears</i>, to permit of
subsequent proceedings against Galileo. But the whole thesis is otiose.
It is admitted (Gebler, p. 89) that Galileo was admonished &ldquo;not
to defend or hold the Copernican doctrine.&rdquo; Gebler contends,
however, that this was not a command to keep &ldquo;entire
silence,&rdquo; and that therefore Galileo is not justly to be charged
with having disobeyed the injunction of the Inquisition when, in his
<i>Dialogues on the Two Principal Systems of the World, the Ptolemaic
and Copernican</i> (1632), he dealt dialectically with the subject,
neither affirming nor denying, but treating both theories as
hypotheses. But the real issue is not Galileo&rsquo;s cautious
disobedience (see Gebler&rsquo;s own admissions, p. 149) to an
irrational decree, but the crime of the Church in silencing him. It is
not likely that the &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; of Galileo, as Gebler
supposes (pp. 90, 338), anticipated his later dialectical handling of
the subject, and so falsified the decision of the Inquisition against
him in 1616. Gebler had at first adopted the German theory that the
absolute command to silence was forged in 1632; and, finding the
document certainly belonged to 1616, framed the new theory, quite
unnecessarily, to save Galileo&rsquo;s credit. The two records are
quite in the spirit and manner of Inquisitorial diplomacy. As Berti
remarks, &ldquo;the Holy Office proceeded with much heedlessness
(<i lang="it">legerezza</i>) and much confusion&rdquo; in 1616. Its
first judgment, in either form, merely emphasizes the guilt of the
second. Cp. Fahie, pp. 167&ndash;69.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Thus officially &ldquo;admonished&rdquo; for his heresy,
but not punished, in 1616, Galileo kept silence for some years, till in
1618 he published his (erroneous) theory of the tides, which he sent
with an ironical epistle to the friendly Archduke Leopold of Austria,
professing to be propounding a mere dream, disallowed by the official
veto on Copernicus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5436src" href=
"#xd21e5436" name="xd21e5436src">266</a> This, however, did him less
harm than his essay <i lang="it">Il Saggiatore</i> (&ldquo;The
Scales&rdquo;), in which he opposed the Jesuit Grassi on the question
of comets. Receiving the <i>imprimatur</i> in 1623, it was dedicated to
the new pope, Urban VIII, who, as the Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, had
been Galileo&rsquo;s friend. The latter could now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>hope for
freedom of speech, as he had all along had a number of friends at the
papal court, besides many priests, among his admirers and disciples.
But the enmity of the Jesuits countervailed all. They did not succeed
in procuring a censure of the <i>Saggiatore</i>, though that subtly
vindicates the Copernican system while professing to hold it disproved
by the fiat of the Church;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5451src" href=
"#xd21e5451" name="xd21e5451src">267</a> but when, venturing further,
he after another lapse of years produced his <i>Dialogues on the Two
Systems</i>, for which he obtained the papal <i>imprimatur</i> in 1632,
they caught him in their net. Having constant access to the pope, they
contrived to make him believe that Galileo had ridiculed him in one of
the personages of his Dialogues. It was quite false; but one of the
pope&rsquo;s anti-Copernican arguments was there unconsciously made
light of; and his wounded vanity was probably a main factor in the
impeachment which followed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5460src" href=
"#xd21e5460" name="xd21e5460src">268</a> His Holiness professed to have
been deceived into granting the <i>imprimatur</i>;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5468src" href="#xd21e5468" name="xd21e5468src">269</a> a
Special Commission was set on foot; the proceedings of 1616 were raked
up; and Galileo was again summoned to Rome. He was old and frail, and
sent medical certificates of his unfitness for such travel; but it was
insisted on, and as under the papal tyranny there was no help, he
accordingly made the journey. After many delays he was tried, and, on
his formal abjuration, sentenced to formal imprisonment (1633) for
teaching the &ldquo;absurd&rdquo; and &ldquo;false doctrine&rdquo; of
the motion of the earth and the non-motion of the sun from east to
west. In this case the pope, whatever were his motives, acted as a hot
anti-Copernican, expressing his personal opinion on the question again
and again, and always in an anti-Copernican sense. In both cases,
however, the popes, while agreeing to the verdict, abstained from
officially ratifying it,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5475src" href=
"#xd21e5475" name="xd21e5475src">270</a> so that, in proceeding to
force Galileo to abjure his doctrine, the Inquisition technically
exceeded its powers&mdash;a circumstance in which some Catholics appear
to find comfort. Seeing that three of the ten cardinals named in the
preamble to the sentence did not sign, it has been inferred that they
dissented; but there is no good reason to suppose that either the pope
or they wilfully abstained from signing. They had gained their
point&mdash;the humiliation of the great discoverer.</p>

the Catholic Church been reduced in this matter that part of its
defence of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

unwarrantably asserted that the fixity of the sun and the motion of the
earth were <i>taught in the Scriptures</i>. Sir Robert Inglis is quoted
as having maintained this view in England in 1824 (Mendham, <i>The
Literary Policy of the Church of Rome</i>, 2nd ed. 1830, p. 176), and
the same proposition was maintained in 1850 by a Roman cardinal. See
<i lang="it">Galileo e l&rsquo;Inquisizione</i>, by Monsignor Marini,
Roma, 1850, pp. 1, 53&ndash;54, etc. Had Galileo really taught as is
there asserted, he would only have been assenting to what his priestly
opponents constantly dinned in his ears. But in point of fact he had
not so assented; for in his letter to Castelli (see Gebler, pp.
46&ndash;50) he had earnestly deprecated the argument from the Bible,
urging that, though Scripture could not err, its interpreters might
misunderstand it; and even going so far as to argue, with much
ingenuity, that the story of Joshua, literally interpreted, could be
made to harmonize with the Copernican theory, but not at all with the
Ptolemaic.</p>
<p class="par">The thesis revived by Monsignor Marini deserves to rank
as the highest flight of absurdity and effrontery in the entire
discussion (cp. Berti, <i>Giordano Bruno</i>, 1889, p. 306,

on the falsity and the anti-scriptural character of the doctrine that
the earth moves round the sun (see Berti, <i lang="it">Il Processo</i>,
p. 115 <i>sq.</i>; Gebler, pp. 76&ndash;77, 230&ndash;34); and never

Inquisition&mdash;and this not in a cell, but in the house of an
official&mdash;for only twenty-two days. After the sentence he was
again formally detained for some seventeen days in the Villa Medici,
but was then allowed to return to his own rural home at
Acatri,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5553src" href="#xd21e5553" name=

the so-called &ldquo;prisoner of the Vatican&rdquo; in our own day. The
worst part of the sentence, however, was the placing of all his works,
published and unpublished, on the <i lang="la">Index Expurgatorius</i>,
and the gag thus laid on all utterance of rational scientific thought
in Italy&mdash;an evil of incalculable influence. &ldquo;The lack of
liberty and speculation,&rdquo; writes a careful Italian student,
&ldquo;was the cause of the death first of the <span lang=
"it">Accademia dei Lincei</span>, an institution unique in its time;
then of the <span lang="it">Accademia del Cimento</span>. Thus Italy,
after the marvellous period of vigorous native civilization in the
thirteenth century, after a second period of civilization less native
but still its own, as being Latin, saw itself arrested on the threshold
of a third and not less splendid period. Vexations and prohibitions
expelled courage, spontaneity, and universality from the national mind;
literary style became uncertain, indeterminate; and, forbidden to treat
of government, science, or religion, turned to things frivolous and
fruitless. For the great academies, instituted to renovate and further
the study of natural philosophy, were substituted small ones without
any such aim. Intellectual energy, the love of research and of
objective truth, greatness of feeling and nobility of character, all
suffered. Nothing so injures a people as the compulsion to express or
conceal its thought solely from motives of fear. The nation in which
those conditions were set up became intellectually inferior to those in
which it was possible to pass freely in the vast regions of knowledge.
Her culture grew restricted, devoid of originality, vaporous,
umbratile; there arose habits of servility and dissimulation; great
books, great men, great purposes were denaturalized.&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="par">It was thus in the other countries of Europe that
Galileo&rsquo;s teaching bore its fruit, for he speedily got his
condemned Dialogues published in Latin by the Elzevirs; and in 1638,
also at the hands of the Elzevirs, appeared his <i>Dialogues of the New
Sciences</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, of mechanics and motion], the
&ldquo;foundation of mechanical physics.&rdquo; By this time he was
totally blind, and then only, when physicians could not help him save
by prolonging his life, was he allowed to live under strict
surveillance in Florence, needing a special indulgence from the
Inquisition to permit him even to go to church at Easter. The desire of
his last blind days, to have with him his best-beloved pupil, Father
Castelli, was granted only under rigid limitation and supervision,
though even the papacy could not keep from him the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>plaudits
of the thinkers of Europe. Finally he passed away in his rural
&ldquo;prison&rdquo;&mdash;after five years of blindness&mdash;in 1642,
the year of Newton&rsquo;s birth. At that time his doctrines were under
anathema in Italy, and known elsewhere only to a few. Hobbes in 1634
tried in vain to procure for the Earl of Newcastle a copy of the
earlier <i>Dialogues</i> in London, and wrote: &ldquo;It is not
possible to get it for money.... I hear say it is called-in, in Italy,
as a book that will do more hurt to their religion than all the books
of Luther and Calvin, such opposition they think is between their
religion and natural reason.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5589src"
href="#xd21e5589" name="xd21e5589src">275</a> Not till 1757 did the
papacy permit other books teaching the Copernican system; in 1765
Galileo was still under ban; not until 1822 was permission given to
treat the theory as true; and not until 1835 was the work of Copernicus
withdrawn from the <i>Index</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5599src"

<p class="par">While modern science was thus being placed on its
special basis, a continuous resistance was being made in the schools to
the dogmatism which held the mutilated lore of Aristotle as the sum of
human wisdom. Like the ecclesiastical revolution, this had been
protracted through centuries. Aristotelianism, whether theistic or
pantheistic, whether orthodox or heterodox,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5607src" href="#xd21e5607" name="xd21e5607src">277</a> had become
a dogmatism like another, a code that vetoed revision, a fetter laid on
the mind. Even as a negation of Christian superstition it had become
impotent, for the Peripatetics were not only ready to make common cause
with the Jesuits against Galileo, as we have seen; some of them were
content even to join in the appeal to the Bible.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5619src" href="#xd21e5619" name="xd21e5619src">278</a> The result
of such uncritical partisanship was that the immense service of
Aristotle to mental life&mdash;the comprehensive grasp which gave him
his long supremacy as against rival system-makers, and makes him still
so much more important than any of the thinkers who in the sixteenth
century revolted against him&mdash;was by opponents disregarded and
denied, though the range and depth of his influence are apparent in all
the polemic against him, notably in that of Bacon, who is constantly
citing him, and relates his reasoning to him, however antagonistically,
at every turn.</p>
<p class="par">Naturally, the less sacrosanct dogmatism was the more
freely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=

became numerous and vehement. Luther was a furious
anti-Aristotelian,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5626src" href=

&ldquo;the Genevese have decreed, once and for ever, that they will
never, neither in logic nor in any other branch of learning, turn away
from the teaching of Aristotle.&rdquo; At Oxford the same code
held.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5634src" href="#xd21e5634" name=

it was in a long line from Aristotle that he got his principle of the
eternity of the universe. The Spaniard Ludovicus Vives, too
(1492&ndash;1540), pronounced by Lange one of the clearest heads of his
age, had insisted on progress beyond Aristotle in the spirit of
naturalist science.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5644src" href=

anti-Aristotelian of the century was <span class="sc">Ramus</span>
(Pierre de la Ram&eacute;e, 1515&ndash;1572), whose long and strenuous

the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5653src"
href="#xd21e5653" name="xd21e5653src">284</a> Ramus hardily laid it

message was of more value than his imperfect attempt to supersede the
Aristotelian logic. Bacon, who carried on in England the warfare
against the Aristotelian tradition, never ventured so to express
himself as against the theological tyranny in particular, though, as we
have seen, the general energy and vividness of his argumentation gave
him an influence which undermined the orthodoxies to which he professed
to conform. On the other hand, he did no such service to exact science
as was rendered in his day by Kepler and Galileo and their English
emulators; and his full didactic influence came much later into
play.</p>
<p class="par">Like fallacies to Bacon&rsquo;s may be found in
<span class="sc">Descartes</span>, whose seventeenth-century reputation
as a champion of theism proved mainly the eagerness of theists for a
plausible defence. Already in his own day his arguments were logically
confuted by both Gassendi and Hobbes; and his partial success with
theists was a success of partisanism. It was primarily in respect of
his habitual appeal to reason and argument, in disregard of the
assumptions of faith, and secondarily in respect of his real scientific
work, that he counts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>for freethought. Ultimately his method
undermined his creed; and it is not too much to say of him that, next
to Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5674src"
href="#xd21e5674" name="xd21e5674src">286</a> he laid a good part of
the foundation of modern philosophy and science,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5683src" href="#xd21e5683" name="xd21e5683src">287</a> Gassendi
largely aiding. Though he never does justice to Galileo, from his fear
of provoking the Church, it can hardly be doubted that he owes to him
in large part the early determination of his mind to scientific
methods; for it is difficult to believe that the account he gives of
his mental development in the <i lang="fr">Discours de la
M&eacute;thode</i> (1637) is biographically true. It is rather the
schemed statement, by a ripened mind, of how it might best have been
developed. Nor did Descartes, any more than Bacon, live up to the
intellectual idea he had framed. All through his life he anxiously
sought to propitiate the Church;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5696src"
href="#xd21e5696" name="xd21e5696src">288</a> and his scientific as
well as his philosophic work was hampered in consequence. In England
Henry More, who latterly recoiled from his philosophy, still thought
his physics had been spoiled by fear of the Church, declaring that the
imprisonment of Galileo &ldquo;frighted Des Cartes into such a
distorted description of motion that no man&rsquo;s reason could make
good sense of it, nor modesty permit him to fancy anything nonsense in
so excellent an author.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5714src"
href="#xd21e5714" name="xd21e5714src">289</a></p>
<p class="par">But nonetheless the unusual rationalism of
Descartes&rsquo;s method, avowedly aiming at the uprooting of all his
own prejudices<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5721src" href="#xd21e5721"
name="xd21e5721src">290</a> as a first step to truth, displeased the
Jesuits, and could not escape the hostile attention of the Protestant
theologians of Holland, where Descartes passed so many years of his
life. Despite his constant theism, accordingly, he had at length to
withdraw.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5735src" href="#xd21e5735" name=

philosophy that had arisen in the Christian era. He made real
scientific discoveries, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>too, where Bacon only inspired an
approach and schemed a wandering road to them. He first effectively
applied algebra to geometry; he first scientifically explained the
rainbow; he at once accepted and founded on Harvey&rsquo;s discovery of
the circulation of the blood, which most physiologists of the day
derided; and he welcomed Aselli&rsquo;s discovery of the lacteals,
which was rejected by Harvey.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5750src" href=

<p class="par">Only less important, in some regards, was the influence
of Pierre Gassend or <span class="sc">Gassendi</span>
(1592&ndash;1655), who, living his life as a canon of the Church,
reverted in his doctrine to the philosophy of Epicurus, alike in
physics and ethics.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5769src" href=
"#xd21e5769" name="xd21e5769src">296</a> It seems clear that he never
had any religious leanings, but simply entered the Church on the advice
of friends who pointed out to him how much better a provision it gave,
in income and leisure, than the professorship he held in his youth at
the university of Aix.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5775src" href=
"#xd21e5775" name="xd21e5775src">297</a> Professing like Descartes a
strict submission to the Church, he yet set forth a theory of things
which had in all ages been recognized as fundamentally irreconcilable
with the Christian creed; and his substantial exemption from penalties
is to be set down to his position, his prudence, and his careful
conformities. The correspondent of Galileo and Kepler, he was the
friend of La Mothe le Vayer and Naud&eacute;; and Gui Patin was his
physician and intimate.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5787src" href=
"#xd21e5787" name="xd21e5787src">298</a> Strong as a physicist and
astronomer where Descartes was weak, he divides with him and Galileo
the credit of practically renewing natural philosophy; Newton being
Gassendist rather than Cartesian.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5793src"
href="#xd21e5793" name="xd21e5793src">299</a> Indeed, Gassendi&rsquo;s
youthful attack on the Aristotelian physics (1624) makes him the
predecessor of Descartes; and he expressly opposed his contemporary on
points of physics and metaphysics on which he thought him chimerical,
and so promoted unbelief where Descartes <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

of Gassendi are, with the partial exception of those of Hobbes,
distinctly the most searching and sustained. The later position of
Hume, indeed, is explicitly taken up in the first objection of
Crat&eacute;rus;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5811src" href="#xd21e5811"

reasoning of a modern atheist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5817src"

Descartes were in time placed on the <i>Index</i>, condemned by the
king&rsquo;s council, and even vetoed in the universities, while those
of Gassendi were not, though his early work on Aristotelianism had to
be stopped after the first volume because of the anger it
aroused.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5826src" href="#xd21e5826" name=

former, who are duly vilified by orthodoxy, although certainly no worse
than the average orthodox.</p>
<p class="par">Among his other practical services to rationalism was a
curious experiment, made in a village of the Lower Alps, by way of
investigating the doctrine of witchcraft. A drug prepared by one
sorcerer was administered to others of the craft in presence of
witnesses. It threw them into a deep sleep, on awakening from which
they declared that they had been at a witches&rsquo; Sabbath. As they
had never left their beds, the experiment went far to discredit the
superstition.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5838src" href="#xd21e5838"
name="xd21e5838src">305</a> One significant result of the experiment
was seen in the course later taken by Colbert in overriding a decision
of the Parlement of Rouen as to witchcraft (1670). That Parlement
proposed to burn fourteen sorcerers. Colbert, who had doubtless read
Montaigne as well as Gassendi, gave Montaigne&rsquo;s prescription that
the culprits should be dosed with hellebore&mdash;a medicine for brain
disturbance.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5841src" href="#xd21e5841"
name="xd21e5841src">306</a> In 1672, finally, the king issued a
declaration forbidding the tribunals to admit charges of mere
sorcery;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5846src" href="#xd21e5846" name=
"xd21e5846src">307</a> and any future condemnations were on the score
of blasphemy and poisoning. Yet further, in the section of his
posthumous <i lang="la">Syntagma Philosophicum</i> (1658) entitled
<i lang="la">De Effectibus Siderum</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5865src" href="#xd21e5865" name="xd21e5865src">308</a> Gassendi
dealt the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>first great blow on the rationalist side to the
venerable creed of astrology, assailed often, but to little purpose,
from the side of faith; bringing to his task, indeed, more asperity
than he is commonly credited with, but also a stringent scientific and
logical method, lacking in the polemic of the churchmen, who had
attacked astrology mainly because it ignored revelation. It is sobering
to remember, however, that he was one of those who could not assimilate
Harvey&rsquo;s discovery of the circulation of the blood, which
Descartes at once adopted and propounded.</p>
<p class="par">Such anomalies meet us many times in the history of
scientific as of other lines of thought; and the residual lesson is the
recognition that progress is infinitely multiplex in its causation.
Nothing is more vital in this regard than scientific truth, which is as
a light-house in seas of speculation; and those who, like Galileo and
Descartes, add to the world&rsquo;s exact knowledge, perform a specific
service not matched by that of the Bacons, who urge right method
without applying it. Yet in that kind also an incalculable influence
has been wielded. Many minds can accept scientific truths without being
thereby led to scientific ways of thought; and thus the reasoners and
speculators, the Brunos and the Vaninis, play their fruitful part, as
do the mentors who turn men&rsquo;s eyes on their own vices of
intellectual habit. And in respect of creeds and philosophies, finally,
it is not so much sheer soundness of result as educativeness of method,
effectual appeal to the thinking faculty and to the spirit of reason,
that determines a thinker&rsquo;s influence. This kind of impact we
shall find historically to be the service done by Descartes to European
thought for a hundred years.</p>
<p class="par">From Descartes, then, as regards philosophy, more than
from any professed thinker of his day, but also from the other thinkers
we have noted, from the reactions of scientific discovery, from the
terrible experience of the potency of religion as a breeder of strife
and its impotence as a curber of evil, and from the practical
freethinking of the more open-minded of that age in general, derives
the great rationalistic movement, which, taking clear literary form
first in the seventeenth century, has with some fluctuations broadened
and deepened down to our own day. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69"

Bouterwek, whose sociology, though meritorious, is ill-clarified,
argues that the Inquisition was in a manner congenital to Spain because
before its establishment the suspicion of heresy was already
&ldquo;more degrading in Spain than the most odious crimes in other
countries.&rdquo; But the same might have been said of the other
countries also. As to earlier Spanish heresy see above, vol. i, p. 337

Despite the many fallacies retained by Copernicus from the current
astronomy, he must be pronounced an exceptionally scientific spirit.
Trained as a mathematician, astronomer, and physician, he showed a keen
and competent interest in the practical problem of currency; and one of
the two treatises which alone he published of his own accord was a
sound scheme for the rectification of that of his own government.
Though a canon of Frauenburg, he never took orders; but did manifold
and unselfish secular service.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

study of Bruno is supplied by Owen in his <i>Skeptics of the Italian
Renaissance</i>. He has, however, omitted to embody the later
discoveries of Dufour and Berti, and has some wrong dates. The <i>Life
of Giordano Bruno</i>, by I. Frith (Mrs. Oppenheim), 1887, gives all
the data, but is inadequate on the philosophic side. A competent
estimate is given in the late Prof. Adamson&rsquo;s lectures on <i>The
Development of Modern Philosophy</i>, etc., 1903, ii, 23 <i>sq.</i>;
also in his art. in <i>Encyc. Brit.</i> For a hostile view see Hallam,
<i>Lit. of Europe</i>, ii, 105&ndash;111. The biography of
Bartholm&egrave;ss, <i>Jordano Bruno</i>, 1846, is extremely full and
sympathetic, but was unavoidably loose as to dates. Much new matter has
since been collected, for which see the <i lang="it">Vita di Giordano
Bruno</i> of Domenico Berti, rev. and enlarged ed. 1889; Prof. J. L.
McIntyre, <i>Giordano Bruno</i>, 1903; Dufour, <i lang="fr">Giordano

Gramond, p. 210. Of Vanini, as of Bruno, it is recorded that at the
stake he repelled the proffered crucifix. Owen and other writers, who
justly remark that he well might, overlook the once received belief
that it was the official practice, with obstinate heretics, to proffer
a <i>red-hot</i> crucifix, so that the victim should be sure to spurn
it with open anger.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Owen, pp. 389, 391, and Carriere, pp. 512&ndash;13, as to the worst
calumnies. It is significant that Vanini was tried <i>solely</i> for
blasphemy and atheism. What is proved against him is that he and an
associate practised a rather gross fraud on the English ecclesiastical
authorities, having apparently no higher motive than gain and a free
life. Mr. Christie notes, however, that Vanini in his writings always
speaks very kindly of England and the English, and so did not add
ingratitude to his act of imposture.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="par first">The propagandist literature of deism begins with
an English diplomatist, Lord <span class="sc">Herbert</span> of
Cherbury, the friend of Bacon, who stood in the full stream of the
current freethought of England and France<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5893src" href="#xd21e5893" name="xd21e5893src">1</a> in the first
quarter of the seventeenth century. English deism, as literature, is
thus at its very outset affiliated with French; all of its elements,
critical and ethical, are germinal in Bodin, Montaigne, and Charron,
each and all of whom had a direct influence on English thought; and we
shall find later French thought, as in the cases of Gassendi, Bayle,
Simon, St. Evremond, and Voltaire, alternately influenced by and
reacting on English. But, apart from the undeveloped rationalism of the
Elizabethan period, which never found literary expression, the French
ferment seems to have given the first effective impulse; though it is
to be remembered that about the same time the wars of religion in
Germany, following on an age of theological uproar, had developed a
common temper of indifferentism which would react on the thinking of
men of affairs in France.</p>
<p class="par">We have seen the state of upper-class and middle-class
opinion in France about 1624. It was in Paris in that year that Herbert
published his <i lang="la">De Veritate</i>, after acting for five years
as the English ambassador at the French court&mdash;an office from
which he was recalled in the same year.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5904src" href="#xd21e5904" name="xd21e5904src">2</a> By his own
account the book had been &ldquo;begun by me in England, and formed
there in all its principal parts,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5907src" href="#xd21e5907" name="xd21e5907src">3</a> but finished
at Paris. He had, however, gone to France in 1608, and had served in
various continental wars in the years following; and it was presumably
in these years, not in his youth in England, that he had formed the
remarkable opinions set forth in his epoch-making book. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Hitherto deism had been represented by unpublished
arguments disingenuously dealt with in published answers; henceforth
there slowly grows up a deistic literature. Herbert was a powerful and
audacious nobleman, with a weak king; and he could venture on a
publication which would have cost an ordinary man dear. Yet even he saw
fit to publish in Latin; and he avowed hesitations.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5915src" href="#xd21e5915" name="xd21e5915src">4</a> The most
puzzling thing about it is his declaration that Grotius and the German
theologian Tielenus, having read the book in MS., exhorted him
&ldquo;earnestly to print and publish it.&rdquo; It is difficult to
believe that they had gathered its substance. Herbert&rsquo;s work has
two aspects, a philosophical and a political, and in both it is
remarkable.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5918src" href="#xd21e5918" name=
"xd21e5918src">5</a> Like the <i lang="fr">Discours de la
M&eacute;thode</i> of Descartes, which was to appear thirteen years
later, it is inspired by an original determination to get at the
rational grounds of conviction; and in Herbert&rsquo;s case the
overweening self-esteem which disfigures his <i>Autobiography</i> seems
to have been motive force for the production of a book signally
recalcitrant to authority. Where Bacon attacks Aristotelianism and the
habits of mind it had engendered, Herbert counters the whole conception
of revelation in religion. Rejecting tacitly the theological basis of
current philosophy, he divides the human mind into four
faculties&mdash;Natural Instinct, Internal Sense, External Sense, and
the Discursive faculty&mdash;through one or other of which all our
knowledge emerges. Of course, like Descartes, he makes the first the
verification of his idea of God, pronouncing that to be primary,
independent, and universally entertained, and therefore not lawfully to
be disputed (already a contradiction in terms); but, inasmuch as
scriptural revelation has no place in the process, the position is
conspicuously more advanced than that of Bacon in the <i lang="la">De
Augmentis</i>, published the year before, and even than that of Locke,
sixty years later. On the question of concrete religion Herbert is
still more aggressive. His argument<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5931src"
href="#xd21e5931" name="xd21e5931src">6</a> is, in brief, that no
professed revelation can have a decisive claim to rational acceptance;
that none escapes sectarian dispute in its own field; that, as each one
misses most of the human race, none seems to be divine; and that human
reason can do for morals all that any one of them does. The negative
generalities of Montaigne here pass into a positive anti-Christian
argument; for Herbert goes on to pronounce the doctrine of forgiveness
for faith immoral. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71"
name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Like all pioneers, Herbert falls into some
inconsistencies on his own part; the most flagrant being his claim to
have had a sign from heaven&mdash;that is, a private and special
revelation&mdash;encouraging him to publish his book.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5946src" href="#xd21e5946" name="xd21e5946src">7</a> But his
criticism is nonetheless telling and persuasive so far as it goes, and
remains valid to this day. Nor do his later and posthumous
works<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5952src" href="#xd21e5952" name=
"xd21e5952src">8</a> add to it in essentials, though they do much to
construct the deistic case on historical lines. The <i lang="la">De
religione gentilium</i> in particular is a noteworthy study of
pre-Christian religions, apparently motived by doubt or challenge as to
his theorem of the universality of the God-idea. It proves only racial
universality without agreement; but it is so far a scholarly beginning
of rational hierology. The English <i>Dialogue between a Teacher and
his Pupil</i>, which seems to have been the first form of the <i lang=
"la">Religio Gentilium</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5982src" href=
"#xd21e5982" name="xd21e5982src">9</a> is a characteristic expression
of his whole way of thought, and was doubtless left unpublished for the
prudential reasons which led him to put all his published works in
Latin. But the fact that the Latin quotations are translated shows that
the book had been planned for publication&mdash;a risk which he did
wisely to shun. The remarkable thing is that his Latin books were so
little debated, the <i lang="la">De Veritate</i> being nowhere
discussed before Culverwel.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5994src" href=
"#xd21e5994" name="xd21e5994src">10</a> Baxter in 1672 could say that
Herbert, &ldquo;never having been answered, might be thought
unanswerable&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5997src" href=
"#xd21e5997" name="xd21e5997src">11</a> and his own
&ldquo;answer&rdquo; is merely theological.</p>
<p class="par">The next great freethinking figure in England is
<span class="sc">Thomas Hobbes</span> (1588&ndash;1679), the most
important thinker of his age, after Descartes, and hardly less
influential. But the purpose of Hobbes being always substantially
political and regulative, his unfaith in the current religion is only
incidentally revealed in the writings in which he seeks to show the
need for keeping it under monarchic control.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6007src" href="#xd21e6007" name="xd21e6007src">12</a> Hobbes is
in fact the anti-Presbyterian or anti-Puritan philosopher; and to
discredit anarchic religion in the eyes of the majority he is obliged
to speak as a judicial Churchman. Yet nothing is more certain than that
he was no orthodox Christian; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>and even his professed theism
resolves itself somewhat easily into virtual agnosticism on logical
pressure. No thought of prudence could withhold him from showing, in a
discussion on words, that he held the doctrine of the <i>Logos</i> to
be meaningless.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6015src" href="#xd21e6015"
name="xd21e6015src">13</a> Of atheism he was repeatedly accused by both
royalists and rebels; and his answer was forensic rather than fervent,
alike as to his scripturalism, his Christianity, and his impersonal
conception of Deity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6021src" href=
"#xd21e6021" name="xd21e6021src">14</a> Reviving as he did the ancient
rationalistic doctrine of the eternity of the world,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6046src" href="#xd21e6046" name="xd21e6046src">15</a> he gave
a clear footing for atheism as against the Jud&aelig;o-Christian view.
In affirming &ldquo;one God eternal&rdquo; of whom men &ldquo;cannot
have any idea in their mind, answerable to his nature,&rdquo; he was
negating all creeds. He expressly contends, it is true, for the
principle of a Providence; but it is hard to believe that he laid any
store by prayer, public or private; and it would appear that whatever
thoughtful atheism there was in England in the latter part of the
century looked to him as its philosopher, insofar as it did not derive
from Spinoza.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6051src" href="#xd21e6051"
name="xd21e6051src">16</a> Nor could the Naturalist school of that day
desire a better, terser, or more drastic scientific definition of
religion than Hobbes gave them: &ldquo;Fear of power invisible,
<i>feigned by the mind or imagined from tales publicly allowed</i>,
<span class="sc">Religion</span>; <i>not allowed</i>, <span class=
"sc">Superstition</span>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6070src"
href="#xd21e6070" name="xd21e6070src">17</a> As the Churchmen readily
saw, his insistence on identifying the religion of a country with its
law plainly implied that no religion is any more &ldquo;revealed&rdquo;
than another. With him too begins (1651) the public criticism of the
Bible on literary or documentary grounds;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6075src" href="#xd21e6075" name="xd21e6075src">18</a> though, as

<p class="par">With the partial exception of the more refined and
graceful Pecock, Hobbes has of all English thinkers down to his period
the clearest and hardest head for all purposes of reasoning, save in
the single field of mathematics, where he meddled without mastery; and
against the theologians of his time his argumentation is as a two-edged
sword. That such a man should have been resolutely on the side of the
king in the Civil War is one of the proofs of the essential fanaticism
and arbitrariness of the orthodox Puritans, who plotted more harm to
the heresies they disliked than was ever wreaked on themselves. Hobbes
came near enough being clerically ostracized among the royalists; but
among the earlier Puritans, or under an Independent Puritan Parliament
at any time, he would have stood a fair chance of execution. It was
doubtless largely due to the anti-persecuting influence of Cromwell, as
well as to his having ostensibly deserted the royalists, that Hobbes
was allowed to settle quietly in England after making his submission to
the Rump Parliament in 1651. In 1666 his <i>Leviathan</i> and <i lang=
"la">De Cive</i> were together condemned by the Restoration Parliament
in its grotesque panic of piety after the Great Fire of London; and it
was actually proposed to revive against him the writ <i lang="la">de
heretico comburendo</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6141src" href=
"#xd21e6141" name="xd21e6141src">25</a> but Charles II protected and
pensioned him, though he was forbidden to publish anything further on
burning questions, and <i>Leviathan</i> was not permitted in his
lifetime to be republished in English.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6148src" href="#xd21e6148" name="xd21e6148src">26</a> He was thus
for his generation the typical &ldquo;infidel,&rdquo; the royalist
clergy being perhaps his bitterest enemies. His spontaneous hostility
to fanaticism shaped his literary career, which began in 1628 with a
translation of Thucydides, undertaken by way of showing the dangers of
democracy. Next came the <i lang="la">De Cive</i> (Paris, 1642),
written when he was already an elderly man; and thenceforth the Civil
War tinges his whole temper.</p>
<p class="par">It is in fact by way of a revolt against all theological
ethic, as demonstrably a source of civil anarchy, that Hobbes
formulates <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>a strictly civic or legalist ethic, denying the
supremacy of an abstract or &agrave; priori natural moral law (though
he founded on natural law), as well as rejecting all supernatural
illumination of the conscience.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6161src"
href="#xd21e6161" name="xd21e6161src">27</a> In the Church of Rome
itself there had inevitably arisen the practice of Casuistry, in which
to a certain extent ethics had to be rationally studied; and early
Protestant Casuistry, repudiating the authority of the priest, had to
rely still more on reason.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Compare Whewell, <i>Lectures on the History of
Moral Philosophy</i>, ed. 1862, pp. 25&ndash;38, where it is affirmed
that, after the Reformation, &ldquo;Since the assertions of the teacher
had no inherent authority, he was obliged to give his proofs as well as
his results,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the determination of <i>cases</i> was
replaced by the discipline of <i>conscience</i>&rdquo; (p. 29). There
is an interesting progression in English Protestant casuistry from W.
Perkins (1558&ndash;1602) and W. Ames (pub. 1630), through Bishops Hall
and Sanderson, to Jeremy Taylor. Mosheim (17 Cent. sec. ii, pt. ii,
&sect; 9) pronounces Ames &ldquo;the first among the Reformed who
attempted to elucidate and arrange the science of morals as distinct
from that of dogmatics.&rdquo; See biog. notes on Perkins and Ames in
Whewell, pp. 27&ndash;29, and Reid&rsquo;s Mosheim, p. 681.</p>

<p class="par">But Hobbes passed in two strides to the position that
natural morality is a set of demonstrable inferences as to what

be realized by comparing his positions with those of John Selden, the
most learned and, outside of philosophy, one of the shrewdest of the
men of that generation. Selden was sometimes spoken of by the Hobbists
as a freethinker; and his <i>Table Talk</i> contains some sallies which
would startle the orthodox if publicly delivered;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6203src" href="#xd21e6203" name="xd21e6203src">31</a> but not
only is there explicit testimony by his associates as to his
orthodoxy:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6212src" href="#xd21e6212" name=
"xd21e6212src">32</a> his own treatise, <i lang="la">De Jure Naturali
et Gentium juxta disciplinam Ebr&aelig;orum</i>, maintains the ground
that the &ldquo;Law of Nature&rdquo; which underlies the variants of
the Laws of Nations is limited to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>precepts and traditions
set forth in the Talmud as delivered by Noah to his posterity.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6224src" href="#xd21e6224" name=
"xd21e6224src">33</a> Le Clerc said of the work, justly enough, that in
it &ldquo;Selden only copies the Rabbins, and scarcely ever
reasons.&rdquo; It is likely enough that the furious outcry against
Selden for his strictly historical investigation of tithes, and the
humiliation of apology forced upon him in that connection in
1618,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6227src" href="#xd21e6227" name=
"xd21e6227src">34</a> made him specially chary ever afterwards of any
semblance of a denial of the plenary truth of theological tradition;
but there is no reason to think that he had ever really transcended the
Biblical view of the world&rsquo;s order. He illustrates, in fact, the
extent to which a scholar could in that day be anti-clerical without
being rationalistic. Like the bulk of the Parliamentarians, though
without their fanaticism, he was thoroughly opposed to the political
pretensions of the Church,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6230src" href=
"#xd21e6230" name="xd21e6230src">35</a> desiring however to leave
episcopacy alone, as a matter outside of legislation, when the House of
Commons abolished it. Yet he spoke of the name of Puritan as one which
he &ldquo;trusted he was not either mad enough or foolish enough to
deserve.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6233src" href="#xd21e6233"
name="xd21e6233src">36</a> There were thus in the Parliamentary party
men of very different shades of opinion. The largest party, perhaps,
was that of the fanatics who, as Mrs. Hutchinson&mdash;herself
fanatical enough&mdash;tells concerning her husband, &ldquo;would not
allow him to be religious because his hair was not in their
cut.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6244src" href="#xd21e6244" name=
"xd21e6244src">37</a> Next in strength were the more or less orthodox
but anti-clerical and less pious Scripturalists, of whom Selden was the
most illustrious. By far the smallest group of all were the
freethinkers, men of their type being as often repelled by the zealotry
of the Puritans as by the sacerdotalism of the State clergy. The
Rebellion, in short, though it evoked rationalism, was not evoked by
it. Like all religious strifes&mdash;like the vaster Thirty
Years&rsquo; War in contemporary Germany&mdash;it generated both doubt
and indifferentism in men who would otherwise have remained undisturbed
in orthodoxy.</p>

<p class="par first">When, however, we turn from the higher literary
propaganda to the verbal and other transitory debates of the period of
the Rebellion, we realize how much partial rationalism had hitherto
subsisted without notice. In that immense ferment some very advanced
opinions, such as quasi-Anarchism in politics<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6254src" href="#xd21e6254" name="xd21e6254src">38</a> and
anti-Scripturalism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span>in religion, were more or less directly
professed. In January, 1646 (<span class="sc">N.S.</span>), the
authorities of the City of London, alarmed at the unheard-of amount of
discussion, petitioned Parliament to put down all private
meetings;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6273src" href="#xd21e6273" name=
"xd21e6273src">39</a> and on February 6, 1646 (<span class=
"sc">N.S.</span>), a solemn fast, or &ldquo;day of publique
humiliation,&rdquo; was proclaimed on the score of the increase of
&ldquo;errors, heresies, and blasphemies.&rdquo; On the same grounds,
the Presbyterian party in Parliament pressed an &ldquo;Ordinance for
the <i>suppression</i> of Blasphemies and Heresies,&rdquo; which, long
held back by Vane and Cromwell, was carried in their despite in 1648,
by large majorities, when the royalists renewed hostilities. It enacted
the death penalty against all who should deny the doctrine of the
Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the inspiration of the Bible, a day of
judgment, or a future state; and prescribed imprisonment for
Arminianism, rejection of infant baptism, anti-Sabbatarianism,
anti-Presbyterianism, or defence of the doctrine of Purgatory or the
use of images.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6291src" href="#xd21e6291"
name="xd21e6291src">40</a> And of aggressive heresy there are some
noteworthy traces. In a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;<i>Hell Broke
Loose</i>: a Catalogue of the many spreading Errors, Heresies, and
Blasphemies of these Times, for which we are to be humbled&rdquo;
(March 9, 1646, <span class="sc">N.S.</span>), the first
entry&mdash;and in the similar Catalogue in Edwards&rsquo;s
<i>Gangr&aelig;na</i>, the second entry&mdash;is a citation of the
notable thesis, &ldquo;That the Scripture, whether a true manuscript or
no, whether Hebrew, Greek, or English, is but humane, and not able to
discover a divine God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6309src" href=
"#xd21e6309" name="xd21e6309src">41</a> This is cited from &ldquo;The
Pilgrimage of the Saints, by Lawrence Clarkson,&rdquo; presumably the
Lawrence Clarkson who for his book <i>The Single Eye</i> was sentenced
by resolution of Parliament on September 27, 1650, to be imprisoned,
the book being burned by the common hangman.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6318src" href="#xd21e6318" name="xd21e6318src">42</a> He is
further cited as teaching that even unbaptized persons may preach and
baptize. Of the other heresies cited the principal is the old denial of
a future life, and especially of a physical and future hell. In general
the heresy is pietistic or antinomian; but we have also the declaration
&ldquo;that right Reason is the rule of Faith, and that we are to
believe the Scriptures and the doctrine of the Trinity, Incarnation,
Resurrection, so far as we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>see them to be agreeable to reason
and no further.&rdquo; Concerning Jesus there are various heresies,
from simple Unitarianism to contemptuous disparagement, with the
stipulation for a &ldquo;Christ formed in us.&rdquo; But though there
are cases of unquotable or ribald blasphemy there is little trace of
scholarly criticism of the Bible, of reasoning against miracles or the
inconsistencies of Scripture, as apart from the doctrine of deity.
Nonetheless, it is very credible that &ldquo;multitudes, unsettled ...
have changed their faith, either to Scepticisme, to doubt of
everything, or Atheisme, to believe nothing.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6326src" href="#xd21e6326" name="xd21e6326src">43</a></p>
<p class="par">Against the furious intolerance of the Puritan
legislature some pleaded with new zeal for tolerance all round; arguing
that certainty on articles of faith and points of religion was
impossible&mdash;a doctrine promptly classed as a bad heresy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6334src" href="#xd21e6334" name=
"xd21e6334src">44</a> The plea that toleration would mean concord was
met by the confident and not unfounded retort that the

could.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6340src" href="#xd21e6340" name=
"xd21e6340src">45</a> But this could hardly have been true of all.
Notable among the new parties were the Levellers, who insisted that the
State should leave religion entirely alone, tolerating all creeds,
including even atheism; and who put forward a new and striking ethic,
grounding on &ldquo;universal reason&rdquo; the right of all men to the
soil.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6345src" href="#xd21e6345" name=
"xd21e6345src">46</a> In the strictly theological field the most
striking innovation, apart from simple Unitarianism, is the denial of
the eternity or even the existence of future torments&mdash;a position
first taken up, as we have seen, either by the continental Socinians or
by the unnamed English heretics of the Tudor period, who passed on
their heresy to the time of Marlowe.<a class="noteref" id=

Torments of Hell: the foundations and pillars thereof discover&rsquo;d,

threatened to overwhelm the times, speaks of &ldquo;monsters&rdquo;

persuade others to do the same.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6411src"
href="#xd21e6411" name="xd21e6411src">55</a> Under the rule of
Cromwell, tolerant as he was of Christian sectarianism, and even of
Unitarianism as represented by Biddle, the more advanced heresies would
get small liberty; though that of Thomas Muggleton and John Reeve,
which took shape about 1651 as the Muggletonian sect, does not seem to
have been molested. Muggleton, a mystic, could teach that there was no
devil or evil spirit, save in &ldquo;man&rsquo;s spirit of unclean
reason and cursed imagination&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6414src" href="#xd21e6414" name="xd21e6414src">56</a> but it was
only privately that such men as Henry Marten and Thomas Chaloner, the
regicides, could avow themselves to be of &ldquo;the natural
religion.&rdquo; The statement of Bishop Burnet, following Clarendon,
that &ldquo;many of the republicans began to profess deism,&rdquo;
cannot be taken literally, though it is broadly intelligible that
&ldquo;almost all of them were for destroying all clergymen ... and for
leaving religion free, as they called it, without either encouragement
or restraint.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">See Burnet&rsquo;s <i>History of His Own Time</i>,
bk. i, ed. 1838, p. 43. The phrase, &ldquo;They were for pulling down
the churches,&rdquo; again, cannot be taken literally. Of those who
&ldquo;pretended to little or no religion and acted only upon the
principles of civil liberty,&rdquo; Burnet goes on to name Sidney,
Henry Nevill, Marten, Wildman, and Harrington. The last was certainly
of Hobbes&rsquo;s way of thinking in philosophy (Croom Robertson,
<i>Hobbes</i>, p. 223, <i>note</i>); but Wildman was one of the signers
of the Anabaptist petition to Charles II in 1658 (Clarendon, <i>Hist.
of the Rebellion</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"
name="pb79">79</a>]</span>bk. xv, ed. 1843, p. 855). As to Marten and
Chaloner, see Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Cromwell</i>, iii, 194; and articles
in <i>Nat. Dict. of Biog.</i> Vaughan (<i>Hist. of England</i>, 1840,
ii, 477, <i>note</i>) speaks of Walwyn and Overton as &ldquo;among the
freethinkers of the times of the Commonwealth.&rdquo; They were,
however, Biblicists, not unbelievers. Prof. Gardiner (<i>Hist. of the
Commonwealth and Protectorate</i>, ii, 253, citing a News-letter in the
Clarendon MSS.) finds record in 1653 of &ldquo;a man [who] preached
flat atheism in Westminster Hall, uninterrupted by the soldiers of the
guard&rdquo;; but this obviously counts for little.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Between the advance in speculation forced on by the
disputes themselves, and the usual revolt against the theological
spirit after a long and ferocious display of it, there spread even
under the Commonwealth a new temper of secularity. On the one hand, the
temperamental distaste for theology, antinomian or other, took form in
the private associations for scientific research which were the
antecedents of the Royal Society. On the other hand, the spirit of
religious doubt spread widely in the middle and upper classes; and
between the dislike of the Roundheads for the established clergy and
the anger of the Cavaliers against all Puritanism there was fostered
that &ldquo;contempt of the clergy&rdquo; which had become a clerical
scandal at the Restoration and was to remain so for about a
century.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6456src" href="#xd21e6456" name=
"xd21e6456src">57</a> Their social status was in general low, and their
financial position bad; and these circumstances, possible only in a
time of weakened religious belief, necessarily tended to further the
process of mental change. Within the sphere of orthodoxy, it operated
openly. It is noteworthy that the term &ldquo;rationalist&rdquo;
emerges as the label of a sect of Independents or Presbyterians who
declare that &ldquo;What their reason dictates to them in church or
State stands for good, until they be convinced with
better.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6462src" href="#xd21e6462"
name="xd21e6462src">58</a> The &ldquo;rationalism,&rdquo; so-called, of
that generation remained ostensibly scriptural; but on other lines
thought went further. Of atheism there are at this stage only dubious
biographical and controversial traces, such as Mrs. Hutchinson&rsquo;s
characterization of a Nottingham physician, possibly a deist, as a
&ldquo;horrible atheist,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6465src"
href="#xd21e6465" name="xd21e6465src">59</a> and the Rev. John
Dove&rsquo;s <i>Confutation of Atheism</i> (1640), which does not bear
out its title. Ephraim Pagitt, in his <i>Heresiography</i> (1644),
speaks loosely of an &ldquo;atheistical sect who affirm that
men&rsquo;s soules sleep with them <i>until the day of
judgment</i>&rdquo;; and tells of some alleged atheist merely that he
&ldquo;mocked and jeared at Christ&rsquo;s Incarnation.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6480src" href="#xd21e6480" name=
"xd21e6480src">60</a> Similarly a work, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>entitled <i>Dispute
betwixt an Atheist and a Christian</i> (1646), shows the existence not
of atheists but of deists, and the deist in the dialogue is a
Fleming.</p>
<p class="par">More trustworthy is the allusion in Nathaniel
Culverwel&rsquo;s <i>Discourse of the Light of Nature</i> (written in
1646, published posthumously in 1652) to &ldquo;those lumps and
dunghills of all sects ... that young and upstart generation of gross
anti-scripturalists, that have a powder-plot against the Gospel, that
would very compendiously behead all Christian religion at one blow, a
device which old and ordinary heretics were never acquainted
withal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6495src" href="#xd21e6495"
name="xd21e6495src">61</a> The reference is presumably to the followers
of Lawrence Clarkson. Yet even here we have no mention of atheism,
which is treated as something almost impossible. Indeed, the very
course of arguing in favour of a &ldquo;Light of Nature&rdquo; seems to
have brought suspicion on Culverwel himself, who shows a noticeable
liking for Herbert of Cherbury.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6500src"
href="#xd21e6500" name="xd21e6500src">62</a> He is, however, as may be
inferred from his angry tone towards anti-scripturalists, substantially
orthodox, and not very important.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">It is contended for Culverwel by modern admirers
(ed. cited, p. xxi) that he deserves the praise given by Hallam to the
later Bishop Cumberland as &ldquo;the first Christian writer who sought
to establish systematically the principle of moral right independent of
revelation.&rdquo; [See above, p. 74, the similar tribute of Mosheim to
Ames.] But Culverwel does not really make this attempt. His proposition
is that reason, &ldquo;the candle of the Lord,&rdquo; discovers
&ldquo;that all the moral law is founded in natural and common light,
in the light of reason, and that there is nothing in the mysteries of
the Gospel <i>contrary</i> to the light of reason&rdquo; (Introd.
<i>end</i>); yet he contends not only that faith transcends reason, but
that Abraham&rsquo;s attempt to slay his son was a dutiful obeying of
&ldquo;the God of nature&rdquo; (pp. 225&ndash;26). He does not achieve
the simple step of noting that the recognition of revelation as such
must be performed by reason, and thus makes no advance on the position
of Bacon, much less on those of Pecock and Hooker. His object, indeed,
was not to justify orthodoxy by reason against rationalistic unbelief,
but to make a case for reason in theology against the Lutherans and
others who, &ldquo;because Socinus has burnt his wings at this candle
of the Lord,&rdquo; scouted all use of it (Introd.). Culverwel,
however, was one of the learned group in Emanuel College, Cambridge,
whose tradition developed in the next generation into
Latitudinarianism; and he may be taken as a learned type of a number of
the clergy who were led by the abundant discussion all around them into
professing and encouraging a ratiocinative habit of mind. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>Thus we
find Dean Stuart, Clerk of the Closet to Charles I, devoting one of his
short homilies to Jerome&rsquo;s text, <i lang="la">Tentemus animas
<span class="corr" id="xd21e6516" title="Source: quae">qu&aelig;</span>
deficiunt a fide naturalibus rationibus adjurare</i>. &ldquo;It is not
enough,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;for you to rest in an imaginary faith,
and easiness in beleeving, except yee know also what and why and how
you come to that beleef. Implicite beleevers, ignorant beleevers, the
adversary may swallow, but the understanding beleever hee must chaw,
and pick bones before hee come to assimilate him, and make him like
himself. The implicite beleever stands in an open field, and the enemy
will ride over him easily: the understanding beleever is in a fenced
town.&rdquo; (<i>Catholique Divinity</i>, 1657, pp.
133&ndash;34&mdash;a work written many years earlier.)</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The discourse on Atheism, again, in the posthumous works
of John Smith of Cambridge (d. 1652), is entirely retrospective; but
soon another note is sounded. As early as 1652, the year after the
issue of Hobbes&rsquo;s <i>Leviathan</i>, the prolific Walter
Charleton, who had been physician to the king, published a book
entitled <i>The Darkness of Atheism Expelled by the Light of
Nature</i>, wherein he asserted that England &ldquo;hath of late
produced and doth ... foster more swarms of atheistical monsters ...
than any age, than any Nation hath been infested withal.&rdquo; In the
following year Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, published his
<i>Antidote against Atheism</i>. The flamboyant dedication to
Viscountess Conway affirms that the existence of God is &ldquo;as
clearly demonstrable as any theorem in mathematicks&rdquo;; but, the
reverend author adds, &ldquo;considering the state of things as they
are, I cannot but pronounce that there is more necessity of this my
Antidote than I could wish there were.&rdquo; At the close of the
preface he pleasantly explains that he will use no Biblical arguments,
but talk to the atheist as a &ldquo;mere Naturalist&rdquo;; inasmuch as
&ldquo;he that converses with a barbarian must discourse to him in his
own language,&rdquo; and &ldquo;he that would gain upon the more weak
and sunk minds of sensual mortals is to accommodate himself to their
capacity, who, like the bat and owl, can see nowhere so well as in the
shady glimmerings of their twilight.&rdquo; Then, after some elementary
play with the design argument, the entire Third Book of forty-six folio
pages is devoted to a parade of old wives&rsquo; tales of witches and
witchcraft, witches&rsquo; sabbaths, apparitions, commotions by devils,
ghosts, incubi, polter-geists&mdash;the whole vulgar medley of the
peasant superstitions of Europe.</p>
<p class="par">It is not that the Platonist does violence to his own
philosophic tastes by way of influencing the &ldquo;bats and
owls&rdquo; of atheism. This mass of superstition is his own special
pabulum. In the preface <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href=
"#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>he has announced that, while he may
abstain from the use of the Scriptures, nothing shall restrain him from
telling what he knows of spirits. &ldquo;I am so cautious and
circumspect,&rdquo; he claims, &ldquo;that I make use of no narrations
that either the avarice of the priest or the credulity and fancifulness
of the melancholist may render suspected.&rdquo; As for the
unbelievers, &ldquo;their confident ignorance shall never dash me out
of confidence with my well-grounded knowledge; for I have been no
careless inquirer into these things.&rdquo; It is after a polter-geist
tale of the crassest description that he announces that it was strictly
investigated and attested by &ldquo;that excellently-learned and noble
gentleman, Mr. E. Boyle,&rdquo; who avowed &ldquo;that all his settled
indisposedness to believe strange things was overcome by this special
conviction.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6539src" href=
"#xd21e6539" name="xd21e6539src">63</a> And the section ends with the
proposition: &ldquo;Assuredly that saying is not more true in politick,
<i>No Bishop, no King</i>, than this in metaphysicks, <i>No Spirit, no
God</i>.&rdquo; Such was the mentality of some of the most eminent and
scholarly Christian apologists of the time. It seems safe to conclude
that the Platonist made few converts.</p>
<p class="par">More avowed that he wrote without having read previous
apologists; and others were similarly spontaneous in the defence of the
faith. In 1654 there is noted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6553src" href=
"#xd21e6553" name="xd21e6553src">64</a> a treatise called <i>Atheismus
Vapulans</i>, by William Towers, whose message can in part be inferred
from his title;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6562src" href="#xd21e6562"
name="xd21e6562src">65</a> and in 1657 Charleton issued his
<i>Immortality of the Human Soul demonstrated by the Light of
Nature</i>, wherein the argument, which says nothing of revelation, is
so singularly unconfident, and so much broken in upon by excursus, as
to leave it doubtful whether the author was more lacking in dialectic
skill or in conviction. And still the traces of unbelief multiply.
Baxter and Howe were agreed, in 1658, that there were both
&ldquo;infidels and papists&rdquo; at work around them; and in 1659
Howe writes: &ldquo;I know some leading men are not
Christians.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6568src" href=
"#xd21e6568" name="xd21e6568src">66</a> &ldquo;Seekers, Vanists, and
Behmenists&rdquo; are specified as groups to which both infidels and
papists attach themselves. And Howe, recognizing how religious strifes
promote unbelief, bears witness &ldquo;What a cloudy, wavering,
uncertain, lank, spiritless thing is the faith of Christians in this
age become!... Most content themselves to profess it only as the

<p class="par">Alongside of all this vindication of Christianity there
was going on constant and cruel persecution of heretic Christians. The
Unitarian John Biddle, master of the Gloucester Grammar School, was
dismissed for his denial of the Trinity; and in 1647 he was imprisoned,
and his book burned by the hangman. In 1654 he was again imprisoned;
and in 1655 he was banished to the Scilly Islands. Returning to London
after the Restoration, he was again arrested, and died in gaol in
1662.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6588src" href="#xd21e6588" name=
"xd21e6588src">68</a> Under the Commonwealth (1656) James Naylor, the
Quaker, narrowly escaped death for blasphemy, but was whipped through
the streets, pilloried, bored through the tongue with a hot iron,
branded in the forehead, and sent to hard labour in prison. Many
hundreds of Quakers were imprisoned and more or less cruelly
handled.</p>
<p class="par">From the <i>Origines Sacr&aelig;</i> (1662) of
Stillingfleet, nevertheless, it would appear that both deism and
atheism were becoming more and more common.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6599src" href="#xd21e6599" name="xd21e6599src">69</a> He states
that &ldquo;the most popular pretences of the atheists of our age have
been the irreconcilableness of the account of times in Scripture with
that of the learned and ancient heathen nations, the inconsistency of
the belief of the Scriptures with the principles of reason; and the
account which may be given of the origin of things from the principles
of philosophy without the Scriptures.&rdquo; These positions are at
least as natural to deists as to atheists; and Stillingfleet is later
found protesting against the policy of some professed Christians who
give up the argument from miracles as valueless.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6602src" href="#xd21e6602" name="xd21e6602src">70</a> His whole
treatise, in short, assumes the need for meeting a very widespread
unbelief in the Bible, though it rarely deals with the atheism of which
it so constantly speaks. After the Restoration, naturally, all the new
tendencies were greatly reinforced,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6605src"
href="#xd21e6605" name="xd21e6605src">71</a> alike by the attitude of
the king and his companions, all influenced by French culture, and by
the general reaction against Puritanism. Whatever ways of thought had
been characteristic of the Puritans were now in more or less complete
disfavour; the belief in witchcraft was scouted as much on this ground
as on any other;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6617src" href="#xd21e6617"
name="xd21e6617src">72</a> and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"

audience among royalists, whose enemies had been above all things
Bibliolaters.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">There is evidence that Charles II, at least up to
the time of his becoming a Catholic, and probably even to the end, was
at heart a deist. See Burnet&rsquo;s <i>History of his Own Time</i>,
ed. 1838, pp. 61, 175, and notes; and cp. refs. in Buckle, 3-vol. ed.
i, 362, <i>note</i>; 1-vol. ed. p. 205. St. Evremond, who knew him and
many of his associates, affirmed expressly that Charles&rsquo;s creed
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">&eacute;toit seulement ce qui passe
vulgairement, quoiqu&rsquo; injustement, pour une extinction totale de
Religion: je veux dire le D&eacute;isme</span>&rdquo; (<i lang=
"fr">&OElig;uvres m&eacute;l&eacute;es</i>: t. viii of <i lang=
"fr">&OElig;uvres</i>, ed. 1714, p. 354). His opinion, St. Evremond
admits, was the result of simple recognition of the actualities of
religious life, not of reading, or of much reflection. And his adoption
of Catholicism, in St. Evremond&rsquo;s opinion, was purely political.
He saw that Catholicism made much more than Protestantism for kingly
power, and that his Catholic subjects were the most subservient.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">We gather this, however, still from the apologetic
treatises and the historians, not from new deistic literature; for in
virtue of the Press Licensing Act, passed on behalf of the Church in
1662, no heretical book could be printed; so that Herbert was thus far
the only professed deistic writer in the field, and Hobbes the only
other of similar influence. Baxter, writing in 1655 on <i>The
Unreasonableness of Infidelity</i>, handles chiefly Anabaptists; and in
his <i>Reformed Pastor</i> (1656), though he avows that &ldquo;the
common ignorant people,&rdquo; seeing the endless strifes of the
clergy, &ldquo;are hardened by us against all religion,&rdquo; the only
specific unbelief he mentions is that of &ldquo;the devil&rsquo;s own
agents, the unhappy Socinians,&rdquo; who had written &ldquo;so many
treatises for ... unity and peace.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6654src" href="#xd21e6654" name="xd21e6654src">73</a> But in his
<i>Reasons of the Christian Religion</i>, issued in 1667, he thinks fit
to prove the existence of God and a future state, and the truth and the
supernatural character of the Christian religion. Any deist or atheist
who took the trouble to read through it would have been rewarded by the
discovery that the learned author has annihilated his own case. In his
first part he affirms: &ldquo;If there were no life of Retribution
after this, Obedience to God would be finally men&rsquo;s loss and
ruine: But Obedience to God shall not be finally men&rsquo;s loss and
ruine: Ergo, there is another life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6662src" href="#xd21e6662" name="xd21e6662src">74</a> In the
second part he writes that &ldquo;Man&rsquo;s personal interest is an
unfit rule and measure of God&rsquo;s goodness&rdquo;;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6666src" href="#xd21e6666" name=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>against Christianity based on the inference that
an infinity of stars are inhabited, he writes:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Ask any man who knoweth these things whether all
this earth be any more in comparison of the whole creation than one
Prison is to a Kingdom or Empire, or the paring of one nail ... in
comparison of the whole body. And if God should cast off <i>all this
earth</i>, and use <i>all the sinners</i> in it as they deserve, it is
no more sign of a want of benignity or mercy in him than it is for a
King to cast <i>one subject</i> of a <i>million</i> into a jail ... or
than it is to <i>pare a man&rsquo;s nails</i>, or cut off a wart, or a
hair, or to pull out a rotten aking tooth.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Thus the second part absolutely destroys one of the
fundamental positions of the first. No semblance of levity on the part
of the freethinkers could compare with the profound intellectual
insincerity of such a propaganda as this; and that deism and atheism
continued to gain ground is proved by the multitude of apologetic
treatises. Even in church-ridden Scotland they were found necessary; at
least the young advocate George Mackenzie, afterwards to be famous as
the &ldquo;bluidy Mackenzie&rdquo; of the time of persecution, thought
it expedient to make his first appearance in literature with a
<i>Religio Stoici</i> (1663), wherein he sets out with a refutation of
atheism. It is difficult to believe that his counsel to Christians to
watch the &ldquo;horror-creating beds of dying atheists&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6702src" href="#xd21e6702" name=
"xd21e6702src">77</a>&mdash;a false pretence as it
stands&mdash;represented any knowledge whatever of professed atheism in
his own country; and his discussion of the subject is wholly on the
conventional lines&mdash;notably so when he uses the customary plea,
later associated with Pascal, that the theist runs no risk even if
there is no future life, whereas the atheist runs a tremendous risk if
there is one;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6710src" href="#xd21e6710"
name="xd21e6710src">78</a> but when he writes of &ldquo;that mystery
why the greatest wits are most frequently the greatest
atheists,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6715src" href="#xd21e6715"
name="xd21e6715src">79</a> he must be presumed to refer at least to
deists. And other passages show that he had listened to freethinking
arguments. Thus he speaks<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6720src" href=
"#xd21e6720" name="xd21e6720src">80</a> of those who &ldquo;detract
from Scripture by attributing the production of miracles to natural
causes&rdquo;; and again<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6726src" href=
"#xd21e6726" name="xd21e6726src">81</a> of those who &ldquo;contend
that the Scriptures are written in a mean and low style; are in some
places too mysterious, in others too obscure; contain many things
incredible, many repetitions, and many contradictions.&rdquo; His own
answers are conspicuously weak. In the latter passage he continues:
&ldquo;But those miscreants should consider that much of the
Scripture&rsquo;s native splendour is impaired by its
translators&rdquo;; and as to miracles <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>he makes the inept answer
that if secondary causes were in operation they acted by God&rsquo;s
will; going on later to suggest on his own part that prophecy may be
not a miraculous gift, but &ldquo;a natural (though the highest)
perfection of our human nature.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6733src" href="#xd21e6733" name="xd21e6733src">82</a> Apart from
his weak dialectic, he writes in general with cleverness and literary
finish, but without any note of sincerity; and his profession of
concern that reason should be respected in theology<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6738src" href="#xd21e6738" name="xd21e6738src">83</a> is as
little acted on in his later life as his protest against
persecution.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6743src" href="#xd21e6743"
name="xd21e6743src">84</a> The inference from the whole essay is that
in Scotland, as in England, the civil war had brought up a considerable
crop of reasoned unbelief; and that Mackenzie, professed defender of
the faith as he was at twenty-five, and official persecutor of
nonconformists as he afterwards became, met with a good deal of it in
his cultured circle. In his later booklet, <i>Reason: an Essay</i>
(1690), he speaks of the &ldquo;ridiculous and impudent extravagance of
some who ... take pains to persuade themselves and others that there is
not a God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6750src" href="#xd21e6750"
name="xd21e6750src">85</a> He further coarsely asperses all atheists as
debauchees,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6755src" href="#xd21e6755" name=
"xd21e6755src">86</a> though he avows that &ldquo;Infidelity is not the
cause of false reasoning, because such as are not atheists reason
falsely.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When anti-theistic thought could subsist in the
ecclesiastical climate of Puritan Scotland, it must have flourished
somewhat in England. In 1667 appeared <i>A Philosophicall Essay towards
an eviction of the Being and Attributes of God</i>, etc., of which the
preface proclaims &ldquo;the bold and horrid pride of Atheists and
Epicures&rdquo; who &ldquo;have laboured to introduce into the world a
general Atheism, or at least a doubtful Skepticisme in matters of
Religion.&rdquo; In 1668 was published Meric Casaubon&rsquo;s treatise,
<i>Of Credulity and Incredulity in things Natural, Civil, and
Divine</i>, assailing not only &ldquo;the Sadducism of these times in
denying spirits, witches,&rdquo; etc., but &ldquo;Epicurus ... and the
juggling and false dealing lately used to bring Atheism into
Credit&rdquo;&mdash;a thrust at Gassendi. A similar polemic is entombed
in a ponderous folio &ldquo;romance&rdquo; entitled <i>Bentivolio and
Urania</i>, by Nathaniel Ingelo, D.D., a fellow first of Emanuel
College, and afterwards of Queen&rsquo;s College, Cambridge (1660; 4th
ed. amended, 1682). The second part, edifyingly dedicated to the Earl
of Lauderdale, one of the worst men of his day, undertakes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>to
handle the &ldquo;Atheists, Epicureans, and Skepticks&rdquo;; and in
the preface the atheists are duly vituperated; while Epicurus is
described as a gross sensualist, in terms of the legend, and the
skeptics as &ldquo;resigned to the slavery of vice.&rdquo; In the sixth
book the atheists are allowed a momentary hearing in defence of their
&ldquo;horrid absurdities,&rdquo; from which it appears that there were
current arguments alike anthropological and metaphysical against
theism. The most competent part of the author&rsquo;s own argument,
which is unlimited as to space, is that which controverts the thesis of
the invention of religious beliefs by
&ldquo;politicians&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6773src" href=
"#xd21e6773" name="xd21e6773src">87</a>&mdash;a notion first put in
currency, as we have seen, by those who insisted on the expediency and
value of such inventions; as, Polybius among the ancients, and
Machiavelli among the moderns; and further by Christian priests, who
described all non-Christian religions as human inventions.</p>
<p class="par">Dr. Ingelo&rsquo;s folio seems to have had many readers;
but he avowedly did not look for converts; and defences of the faith on
a less formidable scale were multiplied. A &ldquo;Person of
Honour&rdquo; (Sir Charles Wolseley) produced in 1669 an essay on
<i>The Unreasonableness of Atheism made Manifest</i>, which, without
supplying any valid arguments, gives some explanation of the growth of
unbelief in terms of the political and other antecedents;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6781src" href="#xd21e6781" name=
"xd21e6781src">88</a> and in 1670 appeared Richard Barthogge&rsquo;s
<i>Divine Goodness Explicated and Vindicated from the Exceptions of the
Atheists</i>. Baxter in 1671<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6793src" href=
"#xd21e6793" name="xd21e6793src">89</a> complains that &ldquo;infidels
are grown so numerous and so audacious, and look so big and talk so
loud&rdquo;; and still the process continues. In 1672 Sir William
Temple writes indignantly of &ldquo;those who would pass for wits in
our age by saying things which, David tells us, the fool said in his
heart.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6799src" href="#xd21e6799"
name="xd21e6799src">90</a> In the same year appeared <i>The
Reasonableness of Scripture-Belief</i>, by Sir Charles Wolseley, and
<i>The Atheist Silenced</i>, by one J. M.; in 1674, Dr. Thomas
Good&rsquo;s <i>Firmianus et Dubitantius, or Dialogues concerning
Atheism, Infidelity, and Popery</i>; in 1675, the posthumous treatise
of Bishop Wilkins (d. 1672), <i>Of the Principles and Duties of Natural
Religion</i>, with a preface by Tillotson; and a <i>Brevis
Demonstratio</i>, with the modest sub-title, &ldquo;The Truth of
Christian Religion Demonstrated by Reasons the best that have yet been
out in English&rdquo;; in 1677, Bishop Stillingfleet&rsquo;s <i>Letter
to a Deist</i>; and in 1678 the massive work of Cudworth on <i>The True
Intellectual System of the Universe</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>attacking atheism (not
deism) on philosophic lines which sadly compromised the learned
author.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6830src" href="#xd21e6830" name=
"xd21e6830src">91</a> English dialectic being found insufficient, there
was even produced in 1679 a translation by the Rev. Joshua Bonhome of
the French <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Ath&eacute;isme Convaincu</i> of David
Dersdon, published twenty years before.</p>
<p class="par">All of these works explicitly avow the abundance of
unbelief; Tillotson, himself accused of it, pronounces the age
&ldquo;miserably overrun with Skepticism and Infidelity&rdquo;; and
Wilkins, avowing that these tendencies are common &ldquo;not only among
sensual men of the vulgar sort, but even among those who pretend to a
more than ordinary measure of wit and learning,&rdquo; attempts to meet
them by a purely deistic argument, with a claim for Christianity
appended, as if he were concerned chiefly to rebut atheism, and held
his own Christianity on a very rationalistic tenure. The fact was that
the orthodox clergy were as hard put to it to repel religious
antinomianism on the one hand as to repel atheism on the other; and no
small part of the deistic movement seems to have been set up by the
reaction against pious lawlessness.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6841src"
href="#xd21e6841" name="xd21e6841src">92</a> Thus we have Tillotson,
writing as Dean of Canterbury, driven to plead in his preface to the
work of Wilkins that &ldquo;it is a great mistake&rdquo; to think the
obligation of moral duties &ldquo;doth solely depend upon the
revelation of God&rsquo;s will made to us in the Holy
Scriptures.&rdquo; It was such reasoning that brought upon him the
charge of freethinking.</p>
<p class="par">If it be now possible to form any accurate picture of
the state of belief in the latter part of the seventeenth century, it
may perhaps be done by recognizing three categories of temperament or
mental proclivity. First we have to reckon with the great mass of
people held to religious observance by hebetude,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6846src" href="#xd21e6846" name="xd21e6846src">93</a> devoid of
the deeper mystical impulse or psychic bias which exhibited itself on
the one hand among the dissenters who partly preserved the
&ldquo;enthusiasms&rdquo; of the Commonwealth period, and on the other
among the more cultured pietists of the Church who, banning
&ldquo;enthusiasm&rdquo; in its stronger forms, cultivated a certain
&ldquo;enthusiasm&rdquo; of their own. Religionists of the latter type
were ministered to by superstitious mystics like Henry More, who, even
when undertaking to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; the existence of God and the
separate existence of the soul by argument and by demonology, taught
them to cultivate a &ldquo;warranted enthusiasm,&rdquo; and to
&ldquo;endeavour after a certain principle more noble <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>and
inward than reason itself, and without which reason will falter, or at
least reach but to mean and frivolous things&rdquo; ...
&ldquo;something in me while I thus speak, which I must confess is of
so retruse a nature that I want a name for it, unless I should
adventure to term it divine sagacity, which is the first rise of
successful reason, especially in matters of great comprehension and
moment.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6854src" href="#xd21e6854"
name="xd21e6854src">94</a> There was small psychic difference between
this dubiously draped affirmation of the &ldquo;inner light&rdquo; and
the more orotund proclamations of it by the dissenters who, for a
considerable section of the people, still carried on the tradition of
rapturous pietism; and the dissenters were not always at a disadvantage
in that faculty for rhetoric which has generally been a main factor in
doctrinal religion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6860src" href=
"#xd21e6860" name="xd21e6860src">95</a></p>
<p class="par">From the popular and the eclectic pietist alike the
generality of the Anglican clergy stood aloof; and among them, in turn,
a rationalistic and anti-mythical habit of mind in a manner joined men
who were divided in their beliefs. The clergymen who wrote lawyer-like
treatises against schism were akin in psychosis to those who, in their
distaste for the parade of inspiration, veered towards deism. Tillotson
was not the only man reputed to have done so: fervid dissenters
declared that many of the established clergy paid &ldquo;more respect
to the light of reason than to the light of the Scriptures,&rdquo; and
further &ldquo;left Christ out of their religion, disowned imputed
righteousness, derided the operations of the holy spirit as the empty
pretences of enthusiasts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6868src"
href="#xd21e6868" name="xd21e6868src">96</a> Of men of this
temperament, some would open dialectic batteries against dissent; while
others, of a more searching proclivity, would tend to construct for
themselves a rationalistic creed out of the current medley of
theological and philosophic doctrine. The great mass of course
maintained an allegiance of habit to the main formulas of the faith,
putting quasi-rational aspects on the trinity, providence, redemption,
and the future life, very much as the adherents of political parties
normally vindicate their supposed principles; and there was a good deal
of surviving temperamental piety even in the Restoration
period.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6874src" href="#xd21e6874" name=
"xd21e6874src">97</a> But the outstanding feature of the age, as
contrasted with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>previous periods, was the increasing commonness of
the skeptical or rationalistic attitude in general society. Sir Charles
Wolseley protests<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6885src" href="#xd21e6885"
name="xd21e6885src">98</a> that &ldquo;Irreligion, &rsquo;tis true, in
its practice hath still been the companion of every age, but its open
and public defence seems the peculiar of this&rdquo;; adding that
&ldquo;most of the bad principles of this age are of no earlier a date
than one very ill book, and indeed but the spawn of the
<i>Leviathan</i>.&rdquo; This, as we have seen, is a delusion; but the
influence of Hobbes was a potent factor.</p>
<p class="par">All the while, the censorship of the press, which was
one of the means by which the clerical party under Charles combated
heresy, prevented any new and outspoken writing on the deistic side.
The <i>Treatise of Humane</i> [<i>i.e.</i> Human] <i>Reason</i>
(1674)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6904src" href="#xd21e6904" name=

man-about-town,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6910src" href="#xd21e6910"

Spinoza had done shortly before,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6929src"
href="#xd21e6929" name="xd21e6929src">101</a> that the acceptance of
authority is itself in the last resort grounded in reason. The author
makes no overt attack on religion, and professes Christian belief, but
points out that many modern wars had been on subjects of religion, and
elaborates a skilful argument on the gain to be derived from
toleration. Reason alone, fairly used, will bring a man to the
Christian faith: he who denies this cannot be a Christian. As for
schism, it is created not by variation in belief, but by the refusal to
tolerate it. This ingenious and well-written treatise speedily elicited
three replies, all pronouncing it a pernicious work. Dr. Laney, Bishop
of Ely, is reported to have declared that book and author might fitly
be burned together;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6934src" href=
"#xd21e6934" name="xd21e6934src">102</a> and Dr. Isaac Watts, while
praising it for &ldquo;many useful notions,&rdquo; found it

degree very dangerous.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6943src" href=

1680, three years after Clifford&rsquo;s death, there appeared <i>An
Apology for a Treatise of Humane Reason</i>, by Albertus Warren,
wherein one of the attacks, entitled <i>Plain Dealing</i>, by a
Cambridge scholar, is specially answered.<a class="noteref" id=

Reason</i> (1681), by Robert Boyle, the distinguished author of <i>The
Sceptical Chemist</i>, whom we have seen backing up Henry More in
acceptance of the grossest of ignorant superstitions. The most notable
thing about the <i>Discourse</i> is that it anticipates
Berkeley&rsquo;s argument against freethinking mathematicians.<a class=

<p class="par">The stress of new discussion is further to be gathered
from the work of Howe, <i>On the Reconcilableness of God&rsquo;s
Prescience of the Sins of Men with the Wisdom and Sincerity of his
Counsels and Exhortations</i>, produced in 1677 at Boyle&rsquo;s
request. As a modern admirer admits that the thesis was a hopeless
one,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6987src" href="#xd21e6987" name=
"xd21e6987src">107</a> it is not to be supposed that it did much to
lessen doubt in its own day. The preface to Stillingfleet&rsquo;s
<i>Letter to a Deist</i> (1677), which for the first time brings that
appellation into prominence in English controversy, tacitly abandoning
the usual ascription of atheism to all unbelievers, avows that &ldquo;a
mean esteem of the Scriptures and the Christian Religion&rdquo; has
become very common &ldquo;among the Skepticks of this Age,&rdquo; and
complains very much, as Butler did sixty years later, of the spirit of
&ldquo;Raillery and Buffoonery&rdquo; in which the matter was too
commonly approached. The &ldquo;Letter&rdquo; shows that a multitude of
the inconsistencies and other blemishes of the Old Testament were being
keenly discussed; and it cannot be said that the Bishop&rsquo;s
vindication was well calculated to check the tendency. Indeed, we have
the angry and reiterated declaration of Archdeacon Parker, writing in
1681, that &ldquo;the ignorant and the unlearned among ourselves are
become the greatest pretenders to skepticism; and it is the common
people that nowadays set up for Skepticism and Infidelity&rdquo;; that
&ldquo;Atheism and Irreligion are at length become as common as Vice
and Debauchery&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;Plebeans and Mechanicks have
philosophized themselves into Principles of Impiety, and read their
Lectures of Atheism in the Streets and Highways. And they are able to
demonstrate out of the <i>Leviathan</i> that there is no God nor
Providence,&rdquo; and so on.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6999src" href=
"#xd21e6999" name="xd21e6999src">108</a> As the Archdeacon&rsquo;s
method of refutation consists mainly in abuse, he doubtless had the
usual measure of success. A similar order of dialectic is employed by
Dr. Sherlock in his <i>Practical Discourse of Religious Assemblies</i>
(1681). The opening section is addressed to the &ldquo;speculative
atheists,&rdquo; here described as receding from the principles of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>their &ldquo;great Master, Mr. Hobbs,&rdquo; who,
&ldquo;though he had no great opinion of religion in itself, yet
thought it something considerable when it became the law of the
nation.&rdquo; Such atheists, the reverend writer notes, when it is
urged on them that all mankind worship &ldquo;some God or other,&rdquo;
reply that such an argument is as good for polytheism and idolatry as
for monotheism; so, after formally inviting them to &ldquo;cure their
souls of that fatal and mortal disease, which makes them beasts here
and devils hereafter,&rdquo; and lamenting that he is not dealing with
&ldquo;reasonable men,&rdquo; he bethinks him that &ldquo;the laws of
conversation require us to treat all men with just respects,&rdquo; and
admits that there have been &ldquo;some few wise and cautious
atheists.&rdquo; To such, accordingly, he suggests that the atheist has
already a great advantage in a world morally restrained by religion,
where he is under no such restraint, and that, &ldquo;if he should by
his wit and learning proselyte a whole nation to atheism, Hell would
break loose on Earth, and he might soon find himself exposed to all
those violences and injuries which he now securely practises.&rdquo;
For the rest, they had better not affront God, who may after all exist,
and be able to revenge himself.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7019src"
href="#xd21e7019" name="xd21e7019src">109</a> And so forth.</p>
<p class="par">Of deists as such, Sherlock has nothing to say beyond
treating as &ldquo;practical atheists&rdquo; men who admit the
existence of God, yet never go to church, though &ldquo;religious
worship is nothing else but a public acknowledgment of God.&rdquo;
Their non-attendance &ldquo;is as great, if not a greater affront to
God, and contempt of him, than atheism itself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7024src" href="#xd21e7024" name="xd21e7024src">110</a> But the
reverend writer&rsquo;s strongest resentment is aroused by the
spectacle of freethinkers asking for liberty of thought.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;It is a fulsome and nauseous thing,&rdquo;
he breathlessly protests, &ldquo;to see the atheists and infidels of
our days to turn great reformers of religion, to set up a mighty cry
for liberty of conscience. For whatever reformation of religion may be
needful at this time, whatever liberty of conscience may be fit to be
granted, yet what have these men to do to meddle with it; those who
think religion a mere fable, and God to be an Utopian prince, and
conscience a man of clouts set up for a scarecrow to fright such silly
creatures from their beloved enjoyments, and hell and heaven to be
forged in the same mint with the poet&rsquo;s Styx and Acheron and
Elysian Fields? We are like to see blessed times, if such men had but

men&rsquo;s consciences, and much less able to keep it; and the great
prevalence of that atheistical doctrine of the <i>Leviathan</i>; and
the unhappy propagation of Erastianism; these things (I say) with some
others have been the sad and fatal causes that have loosed the bands of
conscience and eaten out the very heart and sense of Christianity among
us, to that degree, that there is now scarce any religious tye or
restraint upon persons, but merely from those faint remainders of
natural conscience, which God will be sure to keep alive upon the
hearts of men, as long as they are men, for the great ends of his own
providence, whether they will or no. So that, were it not for this sole
obstacle, religion is not now so much in danger of being divided and
torn piecemeal by sects and factions, as of being at once devoured by
atheism. Which being so, let none wonder that irreligion is accounted
policy when it is grown even to a fashion; and passes for wit, with
some, as well as for wisdom with others.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">How general was the ferment of discussion may be
gathered from Dryden&rsquo;s <i lang="la">Religio Laici</i> (1682),
addressed to the youthful Henry Dickinson, translator of P&egrave;re
Richard Simon&rsquo;s <i>Critical History of the Old Testament</i> (Fr.
1678). The French scholar was suspect to begin with; and Bishop Burnet
tells that Richard Hampden (grandson of the patriot), who was connected
with the Rye House Plot and committed suicide in the reign of William
and Mary, had been &ldquo;much corrupted&rdquo; in his religious
principles by Simon&rsquo;s conversation at Paris. In the poem, Dryden
recognizes the upsetting tendency of the treatise, albeit he terms it
&ldquo;matchless&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">For some, who have his secret meaning guessed,</p>
<p class="line">Have found our author not too much a priest;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">and his flowing disquisition, which starts from
poetic contempt of reason and ends in prosaic advice to keep quiet
about its findings, leaves the matter at that. The hopelessly confused
but musical passage:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Dim as the borrowed beams of moon and stars,</p>
<p class="line">To lonely, weary, wandering travellers,</p>
<p class="line">Is Reason to the soul,</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">begins the poem; but the poet thinks it necessary
both in his preface and in his piece to argue with the deists in a
fashion which must have entertained them as much as it embarrassed the
more thoughtful orthodox, his simple thesis being that all ideas of
deity were <i lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</i> from the primeval revelation
to Noah, and that natural reason could never have attained to a
God-idea at all. And even at that, as regards the Herbertian
argument:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">No supernatural worship can be true,</p>
<p class="line">Because a general law is that alone</p>
<p class="line">Which must to all and everywhere be known:</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">he confesses that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Of all objections this indeed is chief</p>
<p class="line">To startle reason, stagger frail belief;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">and feebly proceeds to argue away the worst
meaning of the creed of &ldquo;the good old man&rdquo; Athanasius.
Finally, we have a fatherly appeal for peace and quietness among the
sects:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">And after hearing what our Church can say,</p>
<p class="line">If still our reason runs another way,</p>
<p class="line">That private reason &rsquo;tis more just to curb</p>
<p class="line">Than by disputes the public peace disturb;</p>
<p class="line">For points obscure are of small use to learn,</p>
<p class="line">But common quiet is mankind&rsquo;s concern.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">It must have been the general disbelief in
Dryden&rsquo;s sincerity on religious matters that caused the
ascription to him of various freethinking treatises, for there is no
decisive evidence that he was ever pronouncedly heterodox. His attitude
to rationalism in the <i lang="la">Religio Laici</i> is indeed that of
one who either could not see the scope of the problem or was determined
not to indicate his recognition of it; and on the latter view the
insincerity of both poem and preface would be exorbitant. By his
nominal hostility to deism, however, Dryden did freethought a service
of some importance. After his antagonism had been proclaimed, no one
could plausibly associate freethinking with licentiousness, in which
Dryden so far exceeded nearly every poet and dramatist of his age that
the non-juror Jeremy Collier was free to single him out as the
representative of theatrical lubricity. But in simple justice it must
also be avowed that of all the opponents of deism in that day he is one
of the least embittered, and that his amiable superficiality of
argument must have tended to stimulate the claims of reason.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The late Dr. Verrall, a keen but unprejudiced
critic, sums up as regards Dryden&rsquo;s religious poetry in general
that &ldquo;What is clear is that he had a marked dislike of clergy of
all sorts, as such&rdquo;; that &ldquo;the main points of Deism are
noted in <i lang="la">Religio Laici</i> (46&ndash;61); and that
&ldquo;his creed was presumably some sort of Deism&rdquo; (<i>Lectures
on Dryden</i>, 1914, pp. 148&ndash;50). Further, &ldquo;<i>The State of
Innocence</i> is really deistic and not Christian in tone: in his play
of <i>Tyrannic Love</i>, the religion of St. Catharine may be mere
philosophy&rdquo;; and though the poet in his preface to that play
protests that his &ldquo;outward conversation shall never be justly
taxed with the note of atheism or profaneness,&rdquo; the disclaimer
&ldquo;proves nothing as to his positive belief: Deism is not
profane.&rdquo; In <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, again, the
&ldquo;coarse satire on Transubstantiation (118 <i>ff.</i>) shows
rather religious insensibility than hostile theology,&rdquo; though
&ldquo;the poem shows his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>dislike of liberty and private
judgment (49&ndash;50).&rdquo; Of the <i lang="la">Religio Laici</i>
the critic asks: &ldquo;Now in all this, is there any religion at
all?&rdquo; The poem &ldquo;might well be dismissed as mere politics
but for its astounding commencement&rdquo; (p. 155). The critic
unexpectedly fails to note that the admired commencement is an
insoluble confusion of metaphors.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">How far the process of reasoning had gone among quiet
thinking people before the Revolution may be gathered from the essay
entitled <i>Miracles no Violations of the Laws of Nature</i>, published
in 1683.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7152src" href="#xd21e7152" name=
"xd21e7152src">113</a> Its thesis is that put explicitly by Montaigne
and implicitly by Bacon, that Ignorance is the only worker of miracles;
in other words, &ldquo;that the power of God and the power of Nature
are one and the same&rdquo;&mdash;a simple and straightforward way of
putting a conception which Cudworth had put circuitously and less
courageously a few years before. No Scriptural miracle is challenged
<i>qua</i> event. &ldquo;Among the many miracles related to be done in
favour of the Israelites,&rdquo; says the writer, &ldquo;there is (I
think) no one that can be apodictically demonstrated to be repugnant to
th&rsquo; establisht Order of Nature&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7158src" href="#xd21e7158" name="xd21e7158src">114</a> and he
calmly accepts the Biblical account of the first rainbow, explaining it
as passing for a miracle merely because it was the first. He takes his
motto from Pliny: &ldquo;Quid non miraculo est, cum primum in notitiam
venit?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7161src" href="#xd21e7161"
name="xd21e7161src">115</a> This is, however, a preliminary strategy;
as is the opening reminder that &ldquo;most of the ancient Fathers ...
and of the most learned Theologues among the moderns&rdquo; hold that
the Scriptures as regards natural things do not design to instruct men
in physics but &ldquo;aim only to excite pious affections in their
breasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">We accordingly reach the position that the Scripture
&ldquo;many times speaks of natural things, yea even of God himself,
very improperly, as aiming to affect and occupy the imagination of men,
not to convince their reason.&rdquo; Many Scriptural narratives,
therefore, &ldquo;are either delivered poetically or related according
to the preconceived opinions and prejudices of the writer.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wherefore we here absolutely conclude that all the events that
are <i>truly</i> related in the Scripture to have come to pass,
proceeded necessarily ... according to the immutable Laws of Nature;
and that if anything be found which can be apodictically demonstrated
to be repugnant to those laws ... we may safely and piously believe the
same not to have been dictated by divine inspiration, but impiously
added to the sacred volume by sacrilegious men; for whatever is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>against Nature is against Reason; and whatever is
against Reason is absurd, and therefore also to be rejected and
refuted.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7173src" href="#xd21e7173"
name="xd21e7173src">116</a></p>
<p class="par">Lest this should be found too hard a doctrine there is
added, &agrave;propos of Joshua&rsquo;s staying of the sun and moon, a
literary solution which has often done duty in later times. &ldquo;To
interpret Scripture-miracles, and to understand from the narrations of
them how they really happened, &rsquo;tis necessary to know the
opinions of those who first reported them ... otherwise we shall
confound ... things which have really happen&rsquo;d with things purely
imaginary, and which were only prophetic representations. For in
Scripture many things are related as real, and which were also
believ&rsquo;d to be real even by the relators themselves, that
notwithstanding were only representations form&rsquo;d in the brain,
and merely imaginary&mdash;as that God, the Supreme Being, descended
from heaven ... upon Mount Sinai...; that Elias ascended to heaven in a
fiery chariot ... which were only representations accommodated to their
opinions who deliver&rsquo;d them down to us.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7178src" href="#xd21e7178" name="xd21e7178src">117</a> Such
argumentation had to prepare the way for Hume&rsquo;s Essay <i>Of
Miracles</i>, half a century later; and concerning both reasoners it is
to be remembered that their thought was to be &ldquo;infidelity&rdquo;
for centuries after them. It needed real freethinking, then, to produce
such doctrine in the days of the Rye House Plot.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, during an accidental lapse of the press laws,
the deist <span class="sc">Charles Blount</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7190src" href="#xd21e7190" name="xd21e7190src">118</a>
(1654&ndash;1693) had produced with his father&rsquo;s help his
<i lang="la">Anima Mundi</i> (1679), in which there is set forth a
measure of cautious unbelief; following it up (1680) by his much more
pronounced essay, <i>Great is Diana of the Ephesians</i>, a keen attack
on the principle of revelation and clericalism in general, and his
translation [from the Latin version] of Philostratus&rsquo;s <i>Life of
Apollonius of Tyana</i>, so annotated<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7208src" href="#xd21e7208" name="xd21e7208src">119</a> as to be
an ingenious counterblast to the Christian claims, and so prefaced as
to be an open challenge to orthodoxy. The book was condemned to be
burnt; and only the influence of Blount&rsquo;s family,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7215src" href="#xd21e7215" name=
"xd21e7215src">120</a> probably, prevented his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>being
prosecuted. The propaganda, however, was resumed by Blount and his
friends in small tracts, and after his suicide<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7235src" href="#xd21e7235" name="xd21e7235src">121</a> in 1693
these were collected as the <i>Oracles of Reason</i> (1693), his
collected works (without the <i>Apollonius</i>) appearing in 1695. By
this time the political tension of the Revolution of 1688 was over; Le
Clerc&rsquo;s work on the inspiration of the Old Testament, raising
many doubts as to the authorship of the Pentateuch, had been translated
in 1690; Spinoza&rsquo;s <i lang="la">Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus</i> (1670) had been translated into English in
1689, and had impressed in a similar sense a number of scholars; his
<i>Ethica</i> had given a new direction to the theistic controversy;
the Boyle Lecture had been established for the confutation of
unbelievers; and after the political convulsion of 1688 has subsided it
rains refutations. Atheism is now so fiercely attacked, and with such
specific arguments&mdash;as in Bentley&rsquo;s Boyle Lectures (1692),
Edwards&rsquo;s <i>Thoughts concerning the Causes of Atheism</i>
(1695), and many other treatises&mdash;that there can be no question as
to the private vogue of atheistic or agnostic opinions. If we are to
judge solely from the apologetic literature, it was more common than
deism. Yet it seems impossible to doubt that there were ten deists for
one atheist. Bentley&rsquo;s admission that he never met an explicit
atheist<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7257src" href="#xd21e7257" name=
"xd21e7257src">122</a> suggests that much of the atheism warred against
was tentative. It was only the deists who could venture on open
avowals; and the replies to them were most discussed.</p>
<div class="par">Much account was made of one of the most compendious,
the <i>Short and Easy Method with the Deists</i> (1697), by the
nonjuror Charles Leslie; but this handy argument (which is really
adopted without acknowledgment from an apologetic treatise by a French
Protestant refugee, published in 1688<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7267src" href="#xd21e7267" name="xd21e7267src">123</a>) was not
only much bantered by deists, but was sharply censured as incompetent
by the French Protestant Le Clerc;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7272src"
href="#xd21e7272" name="xd21e7272src">124</a> and many other disputants
had to come to the rescue. A partial list will suffice to show the rate

unauthorized issue (of course without author&rsquo;s name) of
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <i>Inquiry Concerning Virtue</i> in 1699; and in
that there is little direct conflict with orthodoxy, though it plainly
enough implied that scripturalism would injuriously affect morals. It
seems at that date, perhaps through the author&rsquo;s objection to its
circulation, to have attracted little attention; but he tells that it
incurred hostility.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7701src" href=

two years in 1693 and dropped in 1695; but after the prompt issue of
Blount&rsquo;s collected works in that year, and the appearance of
Toland&rsquo;s <i>Christianity not Mysterious</i> in the next, the new
and comprehensive Blasphemy Law of 1697<a class="noteref" id=

Christian religion, or of the divine authority of the Scriptures, was
made punishable by disability for any civil office; and on a second
offence by three years&rsquo; imprisonment, with withdrawal of all
legal rights. The first clear gain from the freedom of the press was
thus simply a cheapening of books in general. By the Licensing Act of
Charles II, and by a separate patent, the Stationers&rsquo; Company had
a monopoly of printing and selling all classical authors; and while
their editions were disgracefully bad, the importers of the excellent
editions printed in Holland had to pay them a penalty of 6s. 8d. on
each copy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7734src" href="#xd21e7734" name=
"xd21e7734src">129</a> By the same Act, passed under clerical
influence, the number even of master printers and letter-founders had
been reduced, and the number of presses and apprentices strictly
limited; and the total effect of the monopolies was that when
Dutch-printed books were imported in exchange for English, the latter
sold more cheaply at Amsterdam than they did in London, the English
consumer, of course, bearing the burden.<a class="noteref" id=

duties, and at the same time to cheapen English books by leaving
printing free. It will be seen above that the output of treatises
<i>against</i> freethought at once increases in 1696. But the
revolution of 1688, like the Great Rebellion, had doubtless given a new
stimulus to freethinking; and the total effect of freer trade in books,
even with a veto on &ldquo;blasphemy,&rdquo; could only be to further
it. This was ere long to be made plain.</p>

<p class="par first">Alongside of the more popular and native
influences, there were at work others, foreign and more academic; and
even in professedly orthodox writers there are signs of the influence
of deistic thought. Thus Sir Thomas Browne&rsquo;s <i>Religio
Medici</i> (written about 1634, published 1642) has been repeatedly
characterized<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7765src" href="#xd21e7765"
name="xd21e7765src">131</a> as tending to promote deism by its tone and
method; and there can be no question that it assumes a great prevalence
of critical unbelief, to which its attitude is an odd combination of
humorous cynicism and tranquil dogmatism, often recalling
Montaigne,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7777src" href="#xd21e7777" name=
"xd21e7777src">132</a> and at times anticipating Emerson. There is
little savour of confident belief in the smiling maxim that &ldquo;to
confirm and establish our belief &rsquo;tis best to argue with
judgments below our own&rdquo;; or in the avowal, &ldquo;In divinity I
love to keep the road; and though not in an implicit yet an humble
faith, follow the great wheel of the Church, by which I
move.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7780src" href="#xd21e7780"
name="xd21e7780src">133</a> The pose of the typical believer: &ldquo;I
can answer all the objections of Satan and my rebellious reason with
that odd resolution I learned of Tertullian, <i lang="la">Certum est
quia impossibile est</i>,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7789src"
href="#xd21e7789" name="xd21e7789src">134</a> tells in his case of no
anxious hours; and such smiling incuriousness is not conducive to
conviction in others, especially when followed by a recital of some of
the many insoluble dilemmas of Scripture. When he reasons he is merely
self-subversive, as in the saying, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not a ridiculous
devotion to say a prayer before a game at tables; <i>for</i> even in
sortileges and matters of greatest uncertainty there is a settled and
<i>pre-ordered</i> course of effects&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7800src" href="#xd21e7800" name="xd21e7800src">135</a> and after
remarking that the notions of Fortune and astral influence &ldquo;have
perverted the devotion of many into atheism,&rdquo; he proceeds to avow
that his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>many doubts never inclined him &ldquo;to any
point of infidelity or desperate positions of atheism; for I have been
these many years of opinion there never was any.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7807src" href="#xd21e7807" name=
"xd21e7807src">136</a> Yet in his later treatise on <i>Vulgar
Errors</i> (1645) he devotes a chapter<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7816src" href="#xd21e7816" name="xd21e7816src">137</a> to the
activities of Satan in instilling the belief that &ldquo;there is no
God at all ... that the necessity of his entity dependeth upon ours...;
that the natural truth of God is an artificial erection of Man, and the
Creator himself but a subtile invention of the Creature.&rdquo; He
further notes as coming from the same source &ldquo;a secondary and
deductive Atheism&mdash;that although men concede there is a God, yet
should they deny his providence. And therefore assertions have flown
about, that he intendeth only the care of the species or common
natures, but letteth loose the guard of individuals, and single
existences therein.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7822src" href=
"#xd21e7822" name="xd21e7822src">138</a> Browne now asserts merely that
&ldquo;many there are who cannot conceive that there was ever any
absolute Atheist,&rdquo; and does not clearly affirm that Satan labours
wholly in vain. The broad fact remains that he avows &ldquo;reason is a
rebel unto faith&rdquo;; and in the <i>Vulgar Errors</i> he shows in
his own reasoning much of the practical play of the new
skepticism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7828src" href="#xd21e7828" name=
"xd21e7828src">139</a> Yet it is finally on record that in 1664, on the
trial of two women for witchcraft, Browne declared that the fits
suffered from by the children said to have been bewitched &ldquo;were
natural, but heightened by the devil&rsquo;s co-operating with the
malice of the witches, at whose instance he did the
villainies.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7832src" href=
"#xd21e7832" name="xd21e7832src">140</a> This amazing deliverance is
believed to have &ldquo;turned the scale&rdquo; in the minds of the
jury against the poor women, and they were sentenced by the sitting
judge, Sir Matthew Hale, to be hanged. It would seem that in
Browne&rsquo;s latter years the irrational element in him, never long
dormant, overpowered the rational. The judgment is a sad one to have to
pass on one of the greatest masters of prose in any language. In other
men, happily, the progression was different.</p>
<p class="par">The opening even of Jeremy Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Ductor
Dubitantium</i>, so far as it goes, falls little short of the deistic
position.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7843src" href="#xd21e7843" name=
"xd21e7843src">141</a> A new vein of rationalism, too, is opened in the
theological field by the great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102"
href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>Cambridge scholar John
Spencer, whose <i>Discourse concerning Prodigies</i> (1663; 2nd ed.
1665), though quite orthodox in its main positions, has in part the
effect of a plea for naturalism as against supernaturalism.
Spencer&rsquo;s great work, <i lang="la">De legibus Hebr&aelig;orum</i>
(1685), is, apart from Spinoza, the most scientific view of Hebrew
institutions produced before the rise of German theological rationalism
in the latter part of the eighteenth century. Holding most of the
Jewish rites to have been planned by the deity as substitutes for or
safeguards against those of the Gentiles which they resembled, he
unconsciously laid, with Herbert, the foundations of comparative
hierology, bringing to the work a learning which is still serviceable
to scholars.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7858src" href="#xd21e7858"
name="xd21e7858src">142</a> And there were yet other new departures by
clerical writers, who of course exhibit the difficulty of attaining a
consistent rationalism.</p>
<p class="par">One clergyman, Joseph Glanvill, is found publishing a
treatise on <i>The Vanity of Dogmatizing</i> (1661; amended in 1665
under the title <i lang="la">Scepsis Scientifica</i>),<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7875src" href="#xd21e7875" name=
"xd21e7875src">143</a> wherein, with careful reservation of religion,
the spirit of critical science is applied to the ordinary processes of
opinion with much energy, and the &ldquo;mechanical philosophy&rdquo;
of Descartes is embraced with zeal. Following Raleigh and
Hobbes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7884src" href="#xd21e7884" name=
"xd21e7884src">144</a> Glanvill also puts the positive view of
causation<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7890src" href="#xd21e7890" name=

"noteref" id="xd21e7896src" href="#xd21e7896" name=
"xd21e7896src">146</a> Yet he not only vetoed all innovation in
&ldquo;divinity,&rdquo; but held stoutly by the crudest forms of the
belief in witchcraft, and was with Henry More its chief English
champion in his day against rational disbelief.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7902src" href="#xd21e7902" name="xd21e7902src">147</a> In
religion he had so little of the skeptical faculty that he declared
&ldquo;Our religious foundations are fastened at the pillars of the
intellectual world, and the grand articles of our belief as
demonstrable as geometry. Nor will ever either the subtile attempts of
the resolved Atheist, or the passionate hurricanes of the wild
enthusiast, any more be able to prevail against the reason our faith is
built on, than the blustering winds to blow out the
Sun.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7917src" href="#xd21e7917" name=
"xd21e7917src">148</a> He had his due reward in being philosophically
assailed by the Catholic priest Thomas White as a promoter of
skepticism,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7922src" href="#xd21e7922" name=
"xd21e7922src">149</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=

atheist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7936src" href="#xd21e7936" name=
"xd21e7936src">150</a></p>
<p class="par">This was as true as clerical charges of the kind usually
were in the period. But without any animus or violence of
interpretation, a reader of Glanvill&rsquo;s visitation sermon on
<i>The Agreement of Reason and Religion</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7952src" href="#xd21e7952" name="xd21e7952src">151</a> might have
inferred that he was a deist. It sets forth that &ldquo;religion
primarily and mainly consists in worship and vertue,&rdquo; and that it
&ldquo;in a secondary sense consists in some principles relating to the
worship of God, and of his Son, in the ways of devout and vertuous
living&rdquo;; Christianity having &ldquo;superadded&rdquo; baptism and
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper to &ldquo;the religion of mankind.&rdquo; Apart
from his obsession as to witchcraft&mdash;and perhaps even as to
that&mdash;Glanvill seems to have grown more and more rationalistic in
his later years. The <i lang="la">Scepsis</i> omits some of the
credulous flights of the <i>Vanity of Dogmatizing</i>;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7967src" href="#xd21e7967" name=
"xd21e7967src">152</a> the re-written version in the collected
<i>Essays</i> omits such dithyrambs as that above quoted; and the
sermon in its revised form sets out with the emphatic declaration:
&ldquo;There is not anything that I know which hath done more mischief
to religion than the disparaging of reason under pretence of respect
and favour to it; for hereby the very foundations of Christian faith
have been undermined, and the world prepared for atheism. And if reason
must not be heard, the <i>Being</i> of a God and the authority of
Scripture can neither be proved nor defended; and so our faith drops to
the ground like an house that hath no foundation.&rdquo; Such reasoning
could not but be suspect to the orthodoxy of the age.</p>
<p class="par">Apart from the influence of Hobbes, who, like Descartes,
shaped his thinking from the starting-point of Galileo, the Cartesian
philosophy played in England a great transitional part. At the
university of Cambridge it was already naturalized;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7982src" href="#xd21e7982" name="xd21e7982src">153</a> and the
influence of Glanvill, who was an active member of the Royal Society,
must have carried it further. The remarkable treatise of the anatomist
Glisson,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7988src" href="#xd21e7988" name=
"xd21e7988src">154</a> <i lang="la">De natura substanti&aelig;
energetica</i> (1672), suggests the influence of either Descartes or
Gassendi; and it is remarkable that the clerical moralist Cumberland,
writing his <i lang="la">Disquisitio de legibus Natur&aelig;</i> (1672)
in reply to Hobbes, not only takes up a utilitarian position akin to
Hobbes&rsquo;s own, and expressly avoids any appeal to the theological
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>doctrine of future punishments, but introduces
physiology into his ethic to the extent of partially figuring as an
ethical materialist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8003src" href=
"#xd21e8003" name="xd21e8003src">155</a> In regard to Gassendi&rsquo;s
direct influence it has to be noted that in 1659 there appeared <i>The
Vanity of Judiciary Astrology</i>, translated by &ldquo;A Person of
Quality,&rdquo; from P. Gassendus; and further that, as is remarked by
Reid, Locke borrowed more from Gassendi than from any other
writer.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8012src" href="#xd21e8012" name=

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">[It is stated by Sir Leslie Stephen (<i>English
Thought in the Eighteenth Century</i>, 2nd ed. i, 32) that in England
the philosophy of Descartes made no distinguished disciples; and that
John Norris &ldquo;seems to be the only exception to the general
indifference.&rdquo; This overlooks (1) Glanvill, who constantly cites
and applauds Descartes (<i lang="la">Scepsis Scientifica</i>, passim).
(2) In Henry More&rsquo;s <i>Divine Dialogues</i>, again (1668), one of
the disputants is made to speak (<i>Dial.</i> i, ch. xxiv) of
&ldquo;that admired wit Descartes&rdquo;; and he later praises him even
when passing censure (above, p. 65). More had been one of the admirers
in his youth, and changed his view (cp. Ward&rsquo;s <i>Life of Dr.
Henry More</i>, pp. 63&ndash;64). But his first letter to Descartes
begins: &ldquo;<span lang="la">Quanta voluptate perfusus est animus
meus, Vir clarissime, scriptis tuis legendis, nemo quisquam
pr&aelig;ter te unum potest conjectare.</span>&rdquo; (3) There was
published in 1670 a translation of Des Fourneillis&rsquo;s letter in
defence of the Cartesian system, with Fran&ccedil;ois Bayle&rsquo;s
<i>General System of the Cartesian Philosophy</i>. (4) The continual
objections to the atheistic tendency of Descartes throughout
Cudworth&rsquo;s <i>True Intellectual System</i> imply anything but
&ldquo;general indifference&rdquo;; and (5) Barrow&rsquo;s tone in
venturing to oppose him (cit. in Whewell&rsquo;s <i>Philosophy of
Discovery</i>, 1860, p. 179) pays tribute to his great influence. (6)
Molyneux, in the preface to his translation of the <i>Six Metaphysical
Meditations</i> of Descartes in 1680, speaks of him as &ldquo;this
excellent philosopher&rdquo; and &ldquo;this prodigious man.&rdquo; (7)
Maxwell, in a note to his translation (1727) of Bishop
Cumberland&rsquo;s <i lang="la">Disquisitio de legibus
Natur&aelig;</i>, remarks that the doctrine of a universal <i lang=
"la">plenum</i> was accepted from the Cartesian philosophy by
Cumberland, &ldquo;in whose time that philosophy prevailed much&rdquo;
(p. 120). See again (8) Clarke&rsquo;s Answer to Butler&rsquo;s Fifth
Letter (1718) as to the &ldquo;universal prevalence&rdquo; of
Descartes&rsquo;s notions in natural philosophy. (9) The Scottish Lord
President Forbes (d. 1747) summed up that &ldquo;Descartes&rsquo;s
romance kept entire possession of men&rsquo;s belief for fully fifty
years&rdquo; (<i>Works</i>, ii, 132). (10) And his fellow-judge, Sir
William Anstruther, in his &ldquo;Discourse against Atheism&rdquo;
(<i>Essays, Moral and Divine</i>, 1701, pp. 6, 8, 9), cites with much
approval <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>the theistic argument of &ldquo;the celebrated
Descartes&rdquo; as &ldquo;the last evidences which appeared upon the
stage of learning&rdquo; in that connection.</p>
<p class="par">Cp. Berkeley, <i>Siris</i>, &sect; 331. Of Berkeley
himself, Professor Adamson writes (<i>Encyc. Brit.</i> iii, 589) that
&ldquo;Descartes and Locke ... are his real masters in
speculation.&rdquo; The Cartesian view of the eternity and infinity of
matter had further become an accepted ground for &ldquo;philosophical
atheists&rdquo; in England before the end of the century (Molyneux, in
<i>Familiar Letters of Locke and his Friends</i>, 1708, p. 46). As to
the many writers who charged Descartes with promoting atheism, see
Mosheim&rsquo;s notes in Harrison&rsquo;s ed. of Cudworth&rsquo;s
<i>Intellectual System</i>, i, 275&ndash;76; Clarke, as above cited;
Leibnitz&rsquo;s letter to Philip, cited by Latta, <i>Leibnitz</i>,
1898, p. 8, <i>note</i>; and Brewster&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs of Newton</i>,
ii, 315.</p>
<p class="par">Sir Leslie Stephen seems to have followed, under a
misapprehension, Whewell, who contends merely that the Cartesian
doctrine of vortices was never widely accepted in England (<i>Philos.
of Discovery</i>, pp. 177&ndash;78; cp. <i>Hist. of the Induct.
Sciences</i>, ed. 1857, ii, 107, 147&ndash;48). Buckle was perhaps
similarly misled when he wrote in his note-book: &ldquo;Descartes was
never popular in England&rdquo; (<i>Misc. Works</i>, abridged ed. i,
269). Whewell himself mentions that Clarke, soon after taking his
degree at Cambridge, &ldquo;was actively engaged in introducing into
the academic course of study, first, the philosophy of Descartes in its
best form, and, next, the philosophy of Newton&rdquo; (<i>Lectures on
Moral Philosophy</i>, ed. 1862, pp. 97&ndash;98). And Professor Fowler,
in correcting his first remarks on the point, decides that &ldquo;many
of the mathematical teachers at Cambridge continued to teach the
Cartesian system for some time after the publication of Newton&rsquo;s
Principia&rdquo; (ed. of <i>Nov. Org.</i>, p. xi).</p>

<p class="par">It is clear, however, that insofar as new science set up
a direct conflict with Scriptural assumptions it gained ground but
slowly and indirectly. It is difficult to-day to realize with what
difficulty the Copernican and Galilean doctrine of the earth&rsquo;s
rotation and movement round the sun found acceptance even among
studious men. We have seen that Bacon finally rejected it. And as
Professor Masson points out,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8117src" href=
"#xd21e8117" name="xd21e8117src">157</a> not only does Milton seem
uncertain to the last concerning the truth of the Copernican system,
but his friends and literary associates, the
&ldquo;Smectymnuans,&rdquo; in their answer to Bishop Hall&rsquo;s
<i>Humble Remonstrance</i> (1641), had pointed to the Copernican
doctrine as an unquestioned instance of a supreme absurdity. Glanvill,
remarking in 1665 that &ldquo;it is generally opinion&rsquo;d that the
Earth rests as the world&rsquo;s centre,&rdquo; avows that &ldquo;for a
man to go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>about to counter-argue this belief is as
fruitless as to whistle against the winds. I shall not undertake to
maintain the paradox that confronts this almost Catholic opinion. Its
assertion would be entertained with the hoot of the rabble; the very
mention of it as possible, is among the most
ridiculous.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8129src" href=
"#xd21e8129" name="xd21e8129src">158</a> All he ventures to do is to
show that the senses do not really vouch the ordinary view. Not till
the eighteenth century, probably, did the common run of educated people
anywhere accept the scientific teaching.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, however, there was growing up not a
little Socinian and other Unitarianism, for some variety of which we
have seen two men burned in 1612. Church measures had been taken
against the importation of Socinian books as early as 1640. The famous
Lord Falkland, slain in the Civil War, is supposed to have leant to
that opinion;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8139src" href="#xd21e8139"
name="xd21e8139src">159</a> and Chillingworth, whose <i>Religion of
Protestants</i> (1637) was already a remarkable application of rational
tests to ecclesiastical questions in defiance of patristic
authority,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8151src" href="#xd21e8151" name=

&ldquo;persons&rdquo; and &ldquo;subsistence,&rdquo; but was one of
those who sought to help the persecuted Unitarian Biddle. In 1652 the
Parliament ordered the destruction of a certain Socinian Catechism; and
by 1655 the heresy seems to have become common.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">The temper of the Unitarian school appears perhaps at
its best in the anonymous <i>Rational Catechism</i> published in 1686.
It purports to be &ldquo;an instructive conference between a father and
his son,&rdquo; and is dedicated by the father to his two daughters.
The &ldquo;Catechism&rdquo; rises above the common run of its species
in that it is really a dialogue, in which the <i>r&ocirc;les</i> are at
times reversed, and the catechumen is permitted to think and speak for
himself. The exposition is entirely unevangelical. Right religion is
declared to consist in right conduct; and while the actuality of the
Christian record is maintained on argued grounds, on the lines of
Grotius and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>Parker, the doctrine of salvation by faith is
strictly excluded, future happiness being posited as the reward of good
life, not of faith. There is no negation, the author&rsquo;s object
being avowedly peace and conciliation; but the Epistle Dedicatory
declares that religious reasoners have hitherto &ldquo;failed in their
foundation-work. They have too much slighted that philosophy which is
the natural religion of all men; and which, being natural, must needs
be universal and eternal: and upon which therefore, or at least in
conformity with which, all instituted and revealed religion must be
supposed to be built.&rdquo; We have here in effect the position taken
up by Toland ten years later; and, in germ, the principle which
developed deism, albeit in connection with an affirmation of the truth
of the Christian records. Of the central Christian doctrine there is no
acceptance, though there is laudation of Jesus; and reprints after 1695
bore the motto, from Locke:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8191src" href=
"#xd21e8191" name="xd21e8191src">166</a> &ldquo;As the foundation of
virtue, there ought very earnestly to be imprinted on the mind of a
young man a true notion of God, as of the independent supreme Being,
Author, and Maker of all things: And, consequent to this, instil into
him a love and reverence of this supreme Being.&rdquo; We are already
more than half-way from Unitarianism to deism.</p>
<p class="par">Indeed, the theism of Locke&rsquo;s <i>Essay on the
Human Understanding</i> undermined even his Unitarian Scripturalism,
inasmuch as it denies, albeit confusedly, that revelation can ever
override reason. In one passage he declares that &ldquo;reason is
natural revelation,&rdquo; while &ldquo;revelation is natural reason
enlarged by a new set of discoveries communicated by God immediately,
which reason vouchsafes the truth of.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8201src" href="#xd21e8201" name="xd21e8201src">167</a> This
compromise appears to be borrowed from Spinoza, who had put it with
similar vagueness in his great <i>Tractatus</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8209src" href="#xd21e8209" name="xd21e8209src">168</a> of which

"#xd21e8214" name="xd21e8214src">169</a> The <i>Tractatus</i> being
translated into English in the same year with the publication of the
<i>Essay</i>, its influence would concur with Locke&rsquo;s in a
widened circle of readers; and the substantially naturalistic doctrine
of both books inevitably promoted the deistic movement. We have
Locke&rsquo;s own avowal that he had many doubts as to the Biblical
narratives;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8225src" href="#xd21e8225" name=
"xd21e8225src">170</a> and he never attempts to remove the doubts of
others. Since, however, his doctrine provided a sphere for revelation
on the territory of ignorance, giving it prerogative where its
assertions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>were outside knowledge, it counted substantially
for Unitarianism insofar as it did not lead to deism.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">See the <i>Essay</i>, bk. iv, ch. xviii.
Locke&rsquo;s treatment of revelation may be said to be the last and
most attenuated form of the doctrine of &ldquo;two-fold truth.&rdquo;
On his principle, any proposition in a professed revelation that was
not provable or disprovable by reason and knowledge must pass as true.
His final position, that &ldquo;whatever is divine revelation ought to
overrule <i>all</i> our opinions&rdquo; (bk. iv, ch. xviii, &sect; 10),
is tolerably elastic, inasmuch as he really reserves the question of
the actuality of revelation. Thus he evades the central issue.
Naturally he was by critical foreigners classed as a deist. Cp.
Gostwick, <i>German Culture and Christianity</i>, 1882, p. 36. The
German historian Tennemann sums up that Clarke wrote his apologetic
works because &ldquo;the consequences of the empiricism of Locke had
become so decidedly favourable to the cause of atheism, skepticism,
materialism, and irreligion&rdquo; (<i>Manual of the Hist. of
Philos.</i> Eng. tr. Bohn ed. &sect; 349).</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In his &ldquo;practical&rdquo; treatise on <i>The
Reasonableness of Christianity</i> (1695) Locke played a similar part.
It was inspired by the genuine concern for social peace which had moved
him to write an essay on Toleration as early as 1667,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8253src" href="#xd21e8253" name="xd21e8253src">171</a> and to
produce from 1685 onwards his famous <i>Letters on Toleration</i>, by

produced;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8262src" href="#xd21e8262" name=
"xd21e8262src">172</a> all the more successful so far as it went,
doubtless, because the first Letter ended with a memorable capitulation
to bigotry: &ldquo;Lastly, those are not at all to be tolerated who
deny the being of God. Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the
bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist. The taking
away of God, though but even in thought, dissolves all. <i>Besides,
also, those that by their atheism undermine and destroy all religion
can have no pretence of religion whereupon to challenge the privilege
of a toleration.</i>&rdquo; This handsome endorsement of the religion
which had repeatedly &ldquo;dissolved all&rdquo; in a pandemonium of
internecine hate, as compared with the one heresy which had never
broken treaties or shed blood, is presumably more of a prudent
surrender to normal fanaticism than an expression of the
philosopher&rsquo;s own state of mind;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8269src" href="#xd21e8269" name="xd21e8269src">173</a> and his
treatise on <i>The Reasonableness of Christianity</i> is an attempt to
limit religion to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"

reduced to ceremonies, while claiming that the gospel ethic was
&ldquo;now with divine authority established into a legible law, far

to.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8277src" href="#xd21e8277" name=
"xd21e8277src">174</a> Its effect was, however, to promote rationalism
without doing much to mitigate the fanaticism of belief.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Locke&rsquo;s practical position has been fairly
summed up by Prof. Bain: &ldquo;Locke proposed, in his
<i>Reasonableness of Christianity</i>, to ascertain the exact meaning
of Christianity, by casting aside all the glosses of commentators and
divines, and applying his own unassisted judgment to spell out its
teachings.... The fallacy of his position obviously was that he could
not strip himself of his education and acquired notions.... He seemed
unconscious of the necessity of trying to make allowance for his
unavoidable prepossessions. In consequence, he simply fell into an old
groove of received doctrines; and these he handled under the set
purpose of simplifying the fundamentals of Christianity to the utmost.
Such purpose was not the result of his Bible study, but of his wish to
overcome the political difficulties of the time. He found, by keeping
close to the Gospels and making proper selections from the Epistles,
that the belief in Christ as the Messiah could be shown to be the
central fact of the Christian faith; that the other main doctrines
followed out of this by a process of reasoning; and that, as all minds
might not perform the process alike, these doctrines could not be
essential to the practice of Christianity. He got out of the difficulty
of framing a creed, as many others have done, by simply using Scripture
language, without subjecting it to any very strict definition;
certainly without the operation of stripping the meaning of its words,
to see what it amounted to. That his short and easy method was not very
successful the history of the deistical controversy sufficiently
proves&rdquo; (<i>Practical Essays</i>, pp. 226&ndash;27).</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">That Locke was felt to have injured orthodoxy is further
proved by the many attacks made on him from the orthodox side. Even the
first Letter on Toleration elicited retorts, one of which claims to
demonstrate &ldquo;the Absurdity and Impiety of an Absolute
Toleration.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8295src" href=
"#xd21e8295" name="xd21e8295src">175</a> On his positive teachings he
was assailed by Bishop Stillingfleet; by the Rev. John Milner, B.D.; by

B.D.;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8301src" href="#xd21e8301" name=
"xd21e8301src">176</a> his only assailant with a rationalistic repute
being Dr. Thomas Burnet. Some attacked him on his <i>Essays</i>; some

the same tendency to &ldquo;subvert the nature <span class=

hardly of Milner, whose later <i>Account of Mr. Lock&rsquo;s Religion
out of his Own Writings, and in his Own Words</i> (1700), pressed him
shrewdly on the score of his &ldquo;Socinianism.&rdquo; In the eyes of
a pietist like William Law, again, Locke&rsquo;s conception of the
infant mind as a <i lang="la">tabula rasa</i> was &ldquo;dangerous to
religion,&rdquo; besides being philosophically false.<a class="noteref"

<p class="par first">See the <i>Inquiry concerning Virtue or Merit</i>,
pt. iii, &sect; 2; and the <i>Letters to a Student</i>, under date June
3, 1709 (p. 403 in Rand&rsquo;s <i>Life, Letters, etc., of
Shaftesbury</i>, 1900). The extraordinary letter of Newton to Locke,
written just after or during a spell of insanity, first apologizes for
having believed that Locke &ldquo;endeavoured to embroil me with women
and by other means,&rdquo; and goes on to beg pardon &ldquo;for
representing that you struck at the root of morality, in a principle
you laid down in your book of ideas.&rdquo; In his subsequent letter,
replying to that of Locke granting forgiveness and gently asking for
details, he writes: &ldquo;What I said of your book I remember
not.&rdquo; (Letters of September 16 and October 5, 1693, given in Fox
Bourne&rsquo;s <i>Life of Locke</i>, ii, 226&ndash;27, and Sir D.
Brewster&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton</i>, 1855, ii,
148&ndash;51.) Newton, who had been on very friendly terms with Locke,
must have been repeating, when his mind was disordered, criticisms
otherwise current. After printing in full the letters above cited,
Brewster insists, on his principle of sacrificing all other
considerations to Newton&rsquo;s glory (cp. De Morgan, <i>Newton: his
Friend: and his Niece</i>, 1885, pp. 99&ndash;111), that all the while
Newton was &ldquo;in the full possession of his mental powers.&rdquo;
The whole diction of the first letter tells the contrary. If we are not
to suppose that Newton had been temporarily insane, we must think of
his judgment as even less rational, apart from physics, than it is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>seen to be in his dissertations on prophecy.
Certainly Newton was at all times apt to be suspicious of his friends
to the point of moral disease (see his attack on Montague, in his
letter to Locke of January 26, 1691&ndash;1692<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e8397" title="Source: :">;</span> in Fox Bourne, ii, 218; and cp.
De Morgan, as cited, p. 146); but the letter to Locke indicates a point
at which the normal malady had upset the mental balance. It remains,
nevertheless, part of the evidence as to bitter orthodox criticism of
Locke.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">On the whole, it is clear, the effect of his work,
especially of his naturalistic psychology, was to make for rationalism;
and his compromises furthered instead of checking the movement of
unbelief. His ideal of practical and undogmatic Christianity, indeed,
was hardly distinguishable from that of Hobbes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8403src" href="#xd21e8403" name="xd21e8403src">182</a> and, as
previously set forth by the Rev. Arthur Bury in his <i>Naked Gospel</i>
(1690), was so repugnant to the Church that that book was burned at
Oxford as heretical.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8412src" href=
"#xd21e8412" name="xd21e8412src">183</a> Locke&rsquo;s position as a
believing Christian was indeed extremely weak, and could easily have
been demolished by a competent deist, such as Collins,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8415src" href="#xd21e8415" name=
"xd21e8415src">184</a> or a skeptical dogmatist who could control his
temper and avoid the gross misrepresentation so often resorted to by
Locke&rsquo;s orthodox enemies. But by the deists he was valued as an
auxiliary, and by many latitudinarian Christians as a helper towards a
rationalistic if not a logical compromise.</p>
<p class="par">Rationalism of one or the other tint, in fact, seems to
have spread in all directions. Deism was ascribed to some of the most
eminent public men. Bishop Burnet has a violent passage on Sir William
Temple, to the effect that &ldquo;He had a true judgment in affairs,
and very good principles with relation to government, but in nothing
else. He seemed to think that things are as they were from all
eternity; at least he thought religion was only for the mob. He was a
great admirer of the sect of Confucius in China, who were atheists
themselves, but left religion to the rabble.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8423src" href="#xd21e8423" name="xd21e8423src">185</a> The
praise of Confucius is the note of deism; and Burnet rightly held that
no orthodox Christian in those days would sound it. Other prominent men
revealed their religious liberalism. The accomplished and influential
George Savile, Marquis of Halifax, often spoken of as <span class=

publication, and disclosed only in the second edition of Sir David
Brewster&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>. There is indeed no question that he

intellectually pre-eminent; and even on the side of science he was

even in inception, but the expression of his neurotic side; and the
attempt of some of his scientific admirers to show that his religious
researches belong solely to the years of his decline is a corresponding
oversight. Newton was always pathologically prepossessed on the side of
his religion, and subordinated his science to his theology even in the
<i>Principia</i>. It is therefore all the more significant of the set
of opinion in his day that, tied as he was to Scriptural
interpretations, he drew away from orthodox dogma as to the Trinity.
Not only does he show himself a destructive critic of Trinitarian texts
and an opponent of Athanasius<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8515src" href=

"xd21e8532src">199</a> but insofar as his heresy was realized, it must
have wrought much more for unbelief than could be achieved for
orthodoxy by his surprisingly commonplace strictures on atheism, which
show the ordinary inability to see what atheism means.</p>
<p class="par">The argument of his <i>Short Scheme of True Religion</i>
brackets atheism with idolatry, and goes on: &ldquo;Atheism is so
senseless and odious to mankind that it never had many professors.
<i>Can it be by accident</i> that all birds, beasts, and men have their
right side and left side alike shaped (except in their bowels), and
just two eyes, and no more, on either side of the face?&rdquo; etc.
(Brewster, ii, 347). The logical implication is that a monstrous
organism, with the sides unlike, represents &ldquo;accident,&rdquo; and
that in that case there has either been no causation or no
&ldquo;purpose&rdquo; by Omnipotence. It is only fair to remember that
no avowedly &ldquo;atheistic&rdquo; argument could in Newton&rsquo;s
day find publication; but his remarks are those of a man who had never
contemplated philosophically the negation of his own religious
sentiment at the point in question. Brewster, whose judgment and good
faith are alike precarious, writes that &ldquo;When Voltaire asserted
that Sir Isaac explained the prophecies in the same manner as those who
went before him, he only exhibited his ignorance of what Newton wrote,
and what others had written&rdquo; (ii, 331, <i>note</i>; 355). The
writer did not understand what he censured. Voltaire meant that
Newton&rsquo;s treatment of prophecy is on the same plane of credulity
as that of his orthodox predecessors.</p>
<p class="par">Even within the sphere of the Church the Unitarian
tendency, with or without deistic introduction, was traceable.
Archbishop Tillotson (d. 1694) was often accused of Socinianism; and in
the next generation was smilingly spoken of by Anthony Collins as a
leading Freethinker. The pious Dr. Hickes had in fact declared of the
Archbishop that &ldquo;he caused several to turn atheists and ridicule
the priesthood and religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8550src"
href="#xd21e8550" name="xd21e8550src">200</a> The heresy must have been
encouraged even within the Church by the scandal which broke out when
Dean Sherlock&rsquo;s <i>Vindication</i> of Trinitarianism (1690),
written in reply to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"

"noteref" id="xd21e8572src" href="#xd21e8572" name=
"xd21e8572src">202</a> as the work of a Tritheist. The plea of Dr.
Wallis, Locke&rsquo;s old teacher, that a doctrine of &ldquo;three
somewhats&rdquo;&mdash;he objected to the term
&ldquo;persons&rdquo;&mdash;in one God was as reasonable as the concept
of three dimensions,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8576src" href=
"#xd21e8576" name="xd21e8576src">203</a> was of course only a heresy
the more. Outside the Church, William Penn, the great Quaker, held a
partially Unitarian attitude;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8580src" href=
"#xd21e8580" name="xd21e8580src">204</a> and the first of his many
imprisonments was on a charge of &ldquo;blasphemy and heresy&rdquo; in
respect of his treatise <i>The Sandy Foundation Shaken</i>, which
denied (1) that there were in the One God &ldquo;three distinct and
separate persons&rdquo;; (2) the doctrine of the need of &ldquo;plenary
satisfaction&rdquo;; and (3) the justification of sinners by &ldquo;an
imputative righteousness.&rdquo; But though many of the early Quakers
seem to have shunned the doctrine of the Trinity, Penn really affirmed
the divinity of Christ, and was not a Socinian but a Sabellian in his
theology. Positive Unitarianism all the while was being pushed by a
number of tracts which escaped prosecution, being prudently handled by
Locke&rsquo;s friend, Thomas Firmin.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8592src" href="#xd21e8592" name="xd21e8592src">205</a> A new
impulse had been given to Unitarianism by the learning and critical
energy of the Prussian Dr. Zwicker, who had settled in
Holland;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8598src" href="#xd21e8598" name=
"xd21e8598src">206</a> and among those Englishmen whom his works had
found ready for agreement was Gilbert Clerke (b. 1641), who, like
several later heretics, was educated at Sidney College, Cambridge. In
1695 he published a Unitarian work entitled <i>Anti-Nicenismus</i>, and
two other tracts in Latin, all replying to the orthodox polemic of Dr.
Bull, against whom another Unitarian had written <i>Considerations on
the Explications of the Doctrine of the Trinity</i> in 1694, bitterly
resenting his violence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8608src" href=
"#xd21e8608" name="xd21e8608src">207</a> In 1695 appeared yet another
treatise of the same school, <i>The Judgment of the Fathers concerning
the Doctrine of the Trinity</i>. Much was thus done on Unitarian lines
to prepare an audience for the deists of the next reign.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8617src" href="#xd21e8617" name=
"xd21e8617src">208</a> But the most effective influence was probably
the ludicrous strife of the orthodox clergy as to what orthodoxy was.
The fray over the doctrine of the Trinity waxed so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>furious, and the discredit cast on orthodoxy was
so serious,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8628src" href="#xd21e8628" name=
"xd21e8628src">209</a> that in the year 1700 an Act of Parliament was
passed forbidding the publication of any more works on the subject.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile the so-called Latitudinarians,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8639src" href="#xd21e8639" name=
"xd21e8639src">210</a> all the while aiming as they did at a
non-dogmatic Christianity, served as a connecting medium for the
different forms of liberal thought; and a new element of critical
disintegration was introduced by a speculative treatment of Genesis in
the <i lang="fr">Arch&aelig;ologi&aelig; Philosophi&aelig;</i> (1692)
of Dr. Thomas Burnet, a professedly orthodox scholar, Master of the
Charterhouse and chaplain in ordinary to King William, who nevertheless
treated the Creation and Fall stories as allegories, and threw doubt on
the Mosaic authorship of parts of the Pentateuch. Though the book was
dedicated to the king, it aroused so much clerical hostility that the
king was obliged to dismiss him from his post at court.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8657src" href="#xd21e8657" name=
"xd21e8657src">211</a> His ideas were partly popularized through a
translation of two of his chapters, with a vindicatory letter, in
Blount&rsquo;s <i>Oracles of Reason</i> (1695); and that they had
considerable vogue may be gathered from the <i>Essay towards a
Vindication of the Vulgar Exposition of the Mosaic History of the Fall
of Adam</i>, by John Witty, published in 1705. Burnet, who published
three sets of anonymous <i>Remarks</i> on the philosophy of Locke
(1697&ndash;1699), criticizing its sensationist basis, figured after
his death (1715), in posthumous publications, as a heretical theologian
in other regards; and then played his part in the general deistic
movement; but his allegorical view of Genesis does not seem to have
seriously affected speculation in his time, the bulk of the debate
turning on his earlier <i lang="fr">Telluris Theoria Sacra</i> (1681;
trans. 1684), to which there were many rejoinders, both scientific and
orthodox. On this side he is unimportant, his science being wholly
imaginative; and in the competition between his <i>Theory</i> and J.
Woodward&rsquo;s <i>Essay towards a Natural History of the Earth</i>
(1695) nothing was achieved for scientific progress.</p>
<p class="par">Much more remarkable, but outside of popular discussion,
were the <i lang="fr">Evangelium medici</i> (1697) of Dr. <span class=
"sc">B. Connor</span>, wherein the gospel <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>miracles were
explained away, on lines later associated with German rationalism, as
natural phenomena; and the curious treatise of Newton&rsquo;s friend,
John Craig,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8695src" href="#xd21e8695" name=
"xd21e8695src">212</a> <i lang="la">Theologi&aelig; christian&aelig;

"xd21e8711src">213</a> and that accordingly the Christian religion will
cease to be believed about the year 3144, when probably will occur the
Second Coming. Connor, when attacked, protested his orthodoxy; Craig
held successively two prebends of the Church of England;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8717src" href="#xd21e8717" name=
"xd21e8717src">214</a> and both lived and died unmolested, probably
because they had the prudence to write in Latin, and maintained gravity
of style. About this time, further, the title of
&ldquo;Rationalist&rdquo; made some fresh headway as a designation, not
of unbelievers, but of believers who sought to ground themselves on
reason. Such books as those of Clifford and Boyle tell of much
discussion as to the efficacy of &ldquo;reason&rdquo; in religious
things; and in 1686, as above noted, there appears <i>A Rational
Catechism</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8725src" href="#xd21e8725"
name="xd21e8725src">215</a> a substantially Unitarian production,
notable for its aloofness from evangelical feeling, despite its many
references to Biblical texts in support of its propositions. In the
<i>Essays Moral and Divine</i> of the Scotch judge, Sir William
Anstruther, published in 1701, there is a reference to &ldquo;those who
arrogantly term themselves Rationalists&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8731src" href="#xd21e8731" name="xd21e8731src">216</a> in the
sense of claiming to find Christianity not only, as Locke put it, a
reasonable religion, but one making no strain upon faith. Already the
term had become potentially one of vituperation, and it is applied by
the learned judge to &ldquo;the wicked reprehended by the
Psalmist.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8737src" href="#xd21e8737"
name="xd21e8737src">217</a> Forty years later, however, it was still

"xd21e8742src" href="#xd21e8742" name="xd21e8742src">218</a> and it was
to have a still longer lease of life in Germany as a name for
theologians who believed in &ldquo;Scripture&rdquo; on condition that
all miracles were explained away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117"

science. When, in 1647, Hobbes was believed to be dying, Mersenne for
the first time sought to discuss theology with him; but the sick man
instantly changed the subject. In 1648 Mersenne died. He thus did not

vol. ii of the <i>Phenix</i>, 1708, in which the treatise is reprinted,
the same name is given, but with uncertainty. The Richardson pointed at
was the author of <i>The Necessity of Toleration in Matters of
Religion</i> (1647). E. B. Underhill, in his collection of that and
other <i>Tracts on Liberty of Conscience</i> for the Hanserd Knollys

Concerning whom see Macaulay&rsquo;s <i>History</i>, ch. xix, ed. 1877,
ii, 411&ndash;12&mdash;a very prejudiced account. Blount is there
spoken of as &ldquo;one of the most unscrupulous plagiaries that ever
lived,&rdquo; and as having &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; from Milton, because
he issued a pamphlet &ldquo;By Philopatris,&rdquo; largely made up from
the <i>Areopagitica</i>. Compare Macaulay&rsquo;s treatment of Locke,
who adopted Dudley North&rsquo;s currency scheme (ch. xxi, vol. ii, p.
547).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e7190src">&uarr;</a></p>

(art. <span class="sc">Apollonius</span>, note), who is followed by the
French translator of Philostratus with Blount&rsquo;s notes in 1779 (J.
F. Salvemini de Castillon), says the notes were drawn from the papers
of Lord Herbert of Cherbury; but of this Blount says
nothing.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e7208src">&uarr;</a></p>

these see the <i>Dict. of Nat. Biog.</i> The statements of Anthony Wood
as to the writings of Blount&rsquo;s father, relied on in the
author&rsquo;s <i>Dynamics of Religion</i>, appear to be erroneous. Sir
Thomas Pope Blount, Charles&rsquo;s eldest brother, shows a skeptical
turn of mind in his <i>Essays</i> (3rd ed. 1697, <i>Essay 7</i>).
Himself a learned man, he disparages learning as checking thought; and,
professing belief in the longevity of the patriarchs (p. 187),
pronounces popery and pagan religion to be mere works of priestcraft
(<i>Essay 1</i>). He detested theological controversy and intolerance,
and seems to have been a Lockian.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

that is known of this tragedy is that Blount loved his deceased
wife&rsquo;s sister and wished to marry her; but she held it unlawful,
and he was in despair. According to Pope, a sufficiently untrustworthy
authority, he &ldquo;gave himself a stab in the arm, as pretending to
kill himself, of the consequence of which he really died&rdquo; (note
to <i>Epilogue to the Satires</i>, i, 123). An overstrung nervous
system may be diagnosed from his writing.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Blount, after assailing in anonymous pamphlets Bohun the licenser,
induced him to license a work entitled <i>King William and Queen Mary

<i>Christianity not Founded on Argument</i> (by Henry Dodwell, jr.),
1741, pp. 11, 34. Waterland, as cited by Bishop Hurst, treats the terms
<i>Reasonist</i> and <i>Rationalist</i> as labels or nicknames of those
who untruly profess to reason more scrupulously than other people. The
former term may, however, have been set up as a result of Le
Clerc&rsquo;s rendering of &ldquo;the <i>Logos</i>,&rdquo; in John i,
1, by &ldquo;Reason&rdquo;&mdash;an argument to which Waterland

<h2 class="main">FRENCH AND DUTCH FREETHOUGHT IN THE SEVENTEENTH
CENTURY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch15.1" class="par first">1. We have seen France, in the first
quarter of the seventeenth century, pervaded in its upper classes by a
freethought partly born of the knowledge that religion counted for
little but harm in public affairs, partly the result of such
argumentation as had been thrown out by Montaigne and codified by
Charron. That it was not the freethinking of mere idle men of the world
is clear when we note the names and writings of <span class="sc">La
Mothe le Vayer</span> (1588&ndash;1672), <span class="sc">Gui
Patin</span> (1601&ndash;1671), and <span class="sc">Gabriel
Naud&eacute;</span> (1600&ndash;1653), all scholars, all heretics of
the skeptical and rationalistic order. The last two indeed, sided with
the Catholics in politics, Patin approving of the Fronde, and
Naud&eacute; of the Massacre, on which ground they are sometimes
claimed as believers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8776src" href=
"#xd21e8776" name="xd21e8776src">1</a> But though in the nature of the
case their inclusion on the side of freethought is not to be zealously
contended for, they must be classed in terms of the balance of
testimony. Patin was the admiring friend of Gassendi; and though he was
never explicitly heretical, and indeed wrote of Socinianism as a
pestilent doctrine,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8782src" href=
"#xd21e8782" name="xd21e8782src">2</a> his habit of irony and the risk
of written avowals to correspondents must be kept in view in deciding
on his cast of mind. He is constantly anti-clerical;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8788src" href="#xd21e8788" name="xd21e8788src">3</a> and the
germinal skepticism of Montaigne and Charron clearly persists in
him.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">It is true that, as one critic puts it, such
rationalists were not &ldquo;quite clear whither they were bound. At
first sight,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;no one looks more negative than Gui
Patin.... He was always congratulating himself on being
&lsquo;delivered from the nightmare&rsquo;; and he rivals the
eighteenth century in the scorn he pours on priests, monks, and
especially &lsquo;that black Loyolitic scum from Spain&rsquo; which
called itself the Society of Jesus. Yet Patin was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>no
freethinker. Skeptics who made game of the kernel of religion came
quite as much under the lash of his tongue as bigots who dared defend
its husks. His letters end with the characteristic confession:
&lsquo;<i lang="la">Credo in Deum, Christum crucifixum, etc.; ... De
minimis non curat pr&aelig;tor</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; (Viscount St. Cyres in
<i>Cambridge Modern History</i>, v, 73). But the last statement is an
error, and Patin did not attack Gassendi, though he did Descartes. He
says of Rabelais: &ldquo;<span lang="fr">C&rsquo;&eacute;toit un homme
qui se moquoit de tout; en verit&eacute; il y a bien des choses dont on
doit raisonnablement se moquer ... elles sont presque tous remplies de
vanit&eacute;, d&rsquo;imposture et d&rsquo;ignorance: ceux qui sont un
peu philosophes ne doivent-ils pas s&rsquo;en moquer?</span>&rdquo;
(Lett. 485, &eacute;d. cited, iii, 148). Again he writes that
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">la vie humaine n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;un bureau de
rencontre et un th&eacute;&acirc;tre sur lesquels domine la
fortune</span>&rdquo; (Lett. 726, iii, 620). This is pure Montaigne.
The formula cited by Viscount St. Cyres is neither a general nor a
final conclusion to the letters of Patin. It occurs, I think, only once
(18 juillet, 1642, &agrave; M. Belin) in the 836 letters, and
<i>not</i> at the end of that one (Lett. 55, &eacute;d. cited, i,
90).</p>
<p class="par">Concerning his friend Naud&eacute;, Patin writes:
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Je suis fort de l&rsquo;avis de feu M.
Naud&eacute;, qui disoit qu&rsquo;il y avait quatre choses dont il se
fallait garder, afin de n&rsquo;&ecirc;tre point tromp&eacute;, savoir,
de proph&eacute;ties, de miracles, de r&eacute;v&eacute;lations, et
d&rsquo;apparitions</span>&rdquo; (Lett. 353, &eacute;d. cited, ii,
490). Again, he writes of a symposium of Naud&eacute;, Gassendi, and
himself: &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Peut-&ecirc;tre, tous trois,
gu&eacute;ris de loup-garou et delivr&eacute;s du mal des scrupules,
qui est le tyran des consciences, nous irons peut-&ecirc;tre jusque
fort pr&egrave;s du sanctuaire. Je fis l&rsquo;an pass&eacute; ce
voyage de Gentilly avec M. Naud&eacute;, moi seul avec lui
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te; il n&rsquo;y avait point de
t&eacute;moins, aussi n&rsquo;y en falloit-il point: nous y
parl&acirc;mes fort librement de tout, sans que personne en ait
&eacute;t&eacute; scandalis&eacute;</span>&rdquo; (Lett. 362, ii, 508).
This seems tolerably freethinking.</p>
<p class="par">All that the Christian editor cares to claim upon the
latter passage is that assuredly &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">l&rsquo;unit&eacute; de Dieu, l&rsquo;immortalit&eacute; de
l&rsquo;&acirc;me, l&rsquo;&eacute;galit&eacute; des hommes devant la
loi, ces verit&eacute;s fondamentales de la raison <i>et
consacr&eacute;es par le Christianisme</i>, y &eacute;taient
plac&eacute;es au premier rang</span>&rdquo; in the discussion. As to
the skepticism of Naud&eacute; the editor remarks: &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Ce qu&rsquo;il y a de remarquable, c&rsquo;est que Gui Patin
soutenait que son ami ... avait puis&eacute; son opinion, en
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral tr&egrave;s peu orthodoxe, en Italie, pendant le
long s&eacute;jour qu&rsquo;il fit dans ce pays avec le cardinal
Bagni</span>&rdquo; (ii, 490; cp. Lett. 816; iii, 758, where
Naud&eacute; is again cited as making small account of religion).</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Certainly Patin and Naud&eacute; are of less importance
for freethought than La Mothe le Vayer. That scholar, a
&ldquo;Conseiller d&rsquo;Estat ordinaire,&rdquo; tutor of the brother
of Louis XIV, and one of the early members of the new Academy founded
by Richelieu, is an interesting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119"
href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>figure<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8842src" href="#xd21e8842" name="xd21e8842src">4</a> in the
history of culture, being a skeptic of the school of Sextus Empiricus,
and practically a great friend of tolerance. Standing in favour with
Richelieu, he wrote at that statesman&rsquo;s suggestion a treatise
<i>On the Virtue of the Heathen</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8854src" href="#xd21e8854" name="xd21e8854src">5</a> justifying
toleration by pagan example&mdash;a course which raises the question
whether Richelieu himself was not strongly touched by the rationalism
of his age. If it be true that the great Cardinal &ldquo;believed as
all the world did in his time,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8862src" href="#xd21e8862" name="xd21e8862src">6</a> there is
little more to be said; for unbelief, as we have seen, was already
abundant, and even somewhat fashionable. Certainly no ecclesiastic in
high power ever followed a less ecclesiastical policy;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8869src" href="#xd21e8869" name="xd21e8869src">7</a>
and from the date of his appointment as Minister to Louis XIII (1624),
for forty years, there was no burning of heretics or unbelievers in
France. If he was orthodox, it was very passively.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8872src" href="#xd21e8872" name="xd21e8872src">8</a></p>
<p class="par">And Le Vayer&rsquo;s way of handling the dicta of St.
Augustine and Thomas Aquinas as to the virtues of unbelievers being
merely vices is for its time so hardy that the Cardinal&rsquo;s
protection alone can explain its immunity from censure. St. Augustine
and St. Thomas, says the critic calmly, had regard merely to eternal
happiness, which virtue alone can obtain for no one. They are,
therefore, to be always interpreted in this special sense. And so at
the very outset the ground is summarily cleared of orthodox
obstacles.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8882src" href="#xd21e8882" name=
"xd21e8882src">9</a> The <i lang="fr">Petit discours chr&eacute;tien
sur l&rsquo;immortalit&eacute; de l&rsquo;&acirc;me</i>, also addressed
to Richelieu, tells of a good deal of current unbelief on that subject;
and the epistle dedicatory professes pain over the &ldquo;philosopher
of our day [Vanini] who has had the impiety to write that, unless one
is very old, very rich, and a German, one should never expatiate on
this subject.&rdquo; But on the very threshold of the discourse, again,
the skeptic tranquilly suggests that there would be &ldquo;perhaps
something unreasonable&rdquo; in following Augustine&rsquo;s precept,
so popular in later times, that the problem of immortality should be
solved by the dictates of religion and feeling, not of
&ldquo;uncertain&rdquo; reason. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he asks,
&ldquo;should the soul be her own judge?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8893src" href="#xd21e8893" name="xd21e8893src">10</a> And he
shows a distinct appreciation of the avowal of Augustine in his
<i lang="la">Retractationes</i> that his own book on the Immortality of
the Soul was so obscure to him that in many places he himself could not
understand it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8899src" href="#xd21e8899"
name="xd21e8899src">11</a> The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120"
href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>&ldquo;Little Christian
Discourse&rdquo; is, in fact, not Christian at all; and its arguments
are but dialectic exercises, on a par with those of the <i lang=
"fr">Discours sceptique sur la musique</i> which follows. He was, in
short, a skeptic by temperament; and his <i lang="fr">Preface
d&rsquo;une histoire</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e8912src" href=
"#xd21e8912" name="xd21e8912src">12</a> shows his mind to have played
on the &ldquo;Mississippi of falsehood called history&rdquo; very much
as did that of Bayle in a later generation.</p>
<p class="par">Le Vayer&rsquo;s <i>Dialogues of Oratius Tubero</i>
(1633) is philosophically his most important work;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8920src" href="#xd21e8920" name="xd21e8920src">13</a> but its
tranquil Pyrrhonism was not calculated to affect greatly the current
thought of his day; and he ranked rather as a man of all-round
learning<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8926src" href="#xd21e8926" name=
"xd21e8926src">14</a> than as a polemist, being reputed &ldquo;a little
contradictory, but in no way bigoted or obstinate, all opinions being
to him nearly indifferent, excepting those of which faith does not
permit us to doubt.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8932src" href=
"#xd21e8932" name="xd21e8932src">15</a> The last phrase tells of the
fact that it affects to negate: Le Vayer&rsquo;s general skepticism was
well known.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8935src" href="#xd21e8935" name=
"xd21e8935src">16</a> He was not indeed an original thinker, most of
his ideas being echoes from the skeptics of antiquity;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8955src" href="#xd21e8955" name=
"xd21e8955src">17</a> and it has been not unjustly said of him that he

"noteref" id="xd21e8964src" href="#xd21e8964" name=
"xd21e8964src">18</a></p>
<p id="ch15.2" class="par">2. On the other hand, the resort on the part
of the Catholics to a skeptical method, as against both Protestants and
freethinkers, which we have seen originating soon after the issue of
Montaigne&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Essais</i>, seems to have become more
and more common; and this process must rank as in some degree a product
of skeptical thought of a more sincere sort. In any case it was turned
vigorously, even recklessly, against the Protestants. Thus we find
Daill&eacute;, at the outset of his work <i>On the True Use of the
Fathers</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8975src" href="#xd21e8975"
name="xd21e8975src">19</a> complaining that when Protestants quote the
Scriptures some Romanists at once ask &ldquo;whence and in what way
those books may be known to be really written by the prophets and
apostles whose names and titles they bear.&rdquo; This challenge,
rashly incurred by Luther and Calvin in their pronouncements on the
Canon, later Protestants did not as a rule attempt to meet, save in the
fashion of La Placette, who in his work <i lang="la">De insanibili
Ecclesi&aelig; Roman&aelig; Scepticismo</i> (1688)<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8981src" href="#xd21e8981" name="xd21e8981src">20</a>
undertakes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>to show that Romanists themselves are without
any grounds of certitude for the authority of the Church. It was indeed
certain that the Catholic method would make more skeptics than it
won.</p>
<p id="ch15.3" class="par">3. Between the negative development of the
doctrine of Montaigne and the vogue of upper-class deism, the
philosophy of Descartes, with its careful profession of submission to
the Church, had at first an easy reception; and on the appearance of
the <i lang="fr">Discours de la M&eacute;thode</i> (1637) it speedily
affected the whole thought of France; the women of the leisured class,
now much given to literature, being among its students.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8998src" href="#xd21e8998" name=
"xd21e8998src">21</a> From the first the Jansenists, who were the most
serious religious thinkers of the time, accepted the Cartesian system
as in the main soundly Christian; and its founder&rsquo;s authority had
some such influence in keeping up the prestige of orthodoxy as had that
of Locke later in England. Boileau, who wrote a satire in defence of
the system when it was persecuted after Descartes&rsquo;s death, is
named among those whom he so influenced.<a class="noteref" id=

merely external influence of this kind could not counteract the
fundamental rationalism of Descartes&rsquo;s thought, and the whole
social and intellectual tendency towards a secular view of life. Soon,
indeed, Descartes became suspect, partly by reason of the hostile
activities of the Jesuits, who opposed him because the Jansenists

<p id="ch15.4" class="par">4. The general tendency is revealed on the
one hand by the series of treatises from eminent Churchmen, defending
the faith against unpublished attacks, and on the other hand by the
prevailing tone in <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>. Malherbe, the
literary dictator of the first quarter of the century, had died in 1628
with the character of a scoffer;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9105src"
href="#xd21e9105" name="xd21e9105src">32</a> and the fashion now lasted
till the latter half of the reign of Louis XIV. In 1621, two years
after the burning of Vanini, a young man named Jean Fontanier had been
burned alive on the Place de Gr&egrave;ve at Paris, apparently for the
doctrines laid down by him in a manuscript entitled <i lang="fr">Le
Tr&eacute;sor Inestimable</i>, written on deistic and anti-Catholic
lines.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9111src" href="#xd21e9111" name=

Colletet&mdash;who like him were condemned but set free by royal
favour&mdash;appear to be the only others of the kind for over a
generation. Frivolity of tone sufficed to ward off legal pursuit. It
was in 1665, some years after the death of Mazarin, who had maintained
Richelieu&rsquo;s policy of tolerance, that Claude Petit was burnt at
Paris for &ldquo;impious pieces&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=

then there was no general reversion to orthodoxy, the upper-class tone
remaining, as in the age of Richelieu and Mazarin, more or less
unbelieving. When Corneille had introduced a touch of Christian zeal

to the dilettants of both sexes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9142src"

enabled him to sustain himself at all against them.</p>
<p id="ch15.5" class="par">5. Equally freethinking was his brilliant
predecessor and early comrade, <span class="sc">Cyrano de
Bergerac</span> (1620&ndash;1655), who did not fear to indicate his
frame of mind in one of his dramas. In <i lang="fr">La Mort
d&rsquo;Agrippine</i> he puts in the mouth of Sejanus, as was said by a
contemporary, &ldquo;horrible things against the Gods,&rdquo; notably
the phrase, &ldquo;whom men made, and who did not make

href="#xd21e9207" name="xd21e9207src">42</a> At times Cyrano writes
like a deist;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9213src" href="#xd21e9213"

name="xd21e9238src">45</a> In short, he was one of the first of the
hardy freethinkers who, under the tolerant rule of Richelieu and
Mazarin, gave clear voice to the newer spirit. Under any other
government, he would have been in danger of his life: as it was, he was
menaced with prosecutions; his <i lang="fr">Agrippine</i> was
forbidden; the first edition of his <i lang="fr">P&eacute;dant
jou&eacute;</i> was confiscated; during his last illness there was an
attempt to seize his manuscripts; and down till the time of the

destroyed by zealots.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9248src" href=
"#xd21e9248" name="xd21e9248src">46</a> His recent literary
rehabilitation thus hardly serves to realize his importance in the
history of freethought. Between Cyrano and Moli&egrave;re it would
appear that there was little less of rationalistic ferment in the
France of their day than in England. Bossuet avows in a letter to Huet
in 1678 that impiety and unbelief abound more than ever
before.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9251src" href="#xd21e9251" name=

<p id="ch15.6" class="par">6. Even in the apologetic reasoning of the
greatest French prose writer of that age, Pascal, we have the most
pregnant testimony to the prevalence of unbelief; for not only were the
fragments preserved as <i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es</i> (1670), however
originated,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9262src" href="#xd21e9262" name=
"xd21e9262src">48</a> developed as part of a planned defence of
religion against contemporary rationalism,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9276src" href="#xd21e9276" name="xd21e9276src">49</a> but they
themselves show their author profoundly unable to believe save by a
desperate abnegation of reason, though he perpetually commits the gross
fallacy of trusting to reason to prove that reason is untrustworthy.
His work is thus one continuous paralogism, in which reason is
disparaged merely to make way for a parade of bad reasoning. The case
of Pascal is that of Berkeley with a difference: the latter suffered
from hypochondria, but reacted with nervous energy; Pascal, a physical
degenerate, prematurely profound, was prematurely old; and his pietism
in its final form is the expression of the physical collapse.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">This is disputed by M. Lanson, an always weighty
authority. He writes (p. 464) that Pascal was &ldquo;neither mad nor
ill&rdquo; when he gave himself up wholly to religion. But ill he
certainly was. He had <i>chronically</i> suffered from intense pains in
the head from his eighteenth year; and M. Lanson admits (p. 451) that
the <i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es</i> were written in intervals of acute
suffering. This indeed understates the case. Pascal several times told
his family that since the age of eighteen he had never passed a day
without pain. His sister, Madame Perier, in her biographical sketch,
speaks of him as suffering &ldquo;continual and ever-increasing
maladies,&rdquo; and avows that the four last years of his life, in
which he penned the fragments called <i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es</i>,
&ldquo;were but a continual languishment.&rdquo; The Port Royal preface
of 1670 says the same thing, speaking of the &ldquo;four years of
languor and malady in which he wrote all we have of the book he
planned,&rdquo; and calling the <i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es</i>
&ldquo;the feeble essays of a sick man.&rdquo; Cp. Pascal&rsquo;s

was made against them immediately on their publication by the
Abb&eacute; de Villars, who pointed out that they did the reverse of
what they claimed to do in the matter of appealing to the heart and to
good sense, since they set forth all the ordinary arguments of
Pyrrhonism, denied that the existence of God could be established by
reason or philosophy, and staked the case on a &ldquo;wager&rdquo;
which shocked good sense and feeling alike. &ldquo;Have you

<p class="par">The same question arises concerning the famous <i lang=
"fr">Lettres Provinciales</i> (1656), written by Pascal in defence of
Arnauld against the persecution of the Jesuits, who carried on in
Arnauld&rsquo;s case their campaign against Jansen, whom they charged
with mis-stating the doctrine of Augustine in his great work expounding
that Father. Once more the Catholic Church was swerving from its own
established doctrine of predestination, the Spanish Jesuit Molina
having set up a new movement in the Pelagian or Arminian direction. The
cause of the Jansenists has been represented as that of freedom of
thought and speech;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9356src" href=
"#xd21e9356" name="xd21e9356src">54</a> and this it relatively was
insofar as Jansen and Arnauld sought for a hearing, while the
Jesuit-ridden Sorbonne strove to silence and punish them. Pascal had to
go from printer to printer as his Letters succeeded each other, the
first three being successively prosecuted by the clerical authorities;
and in their collected form they found publicity only by being printed
at Rouen and published at Amsterdam, with the rubric of Cologne. All
the while Jansenism claimed to be strict orthodoxy; and it was in
virtue only of the irreducible element of rationalism in Pascal that
the school of Port Royal made for freethought in any higher or more
general sense. Indeed, between his own reputation for piety and that of
the Jansenists for orthodoxy, the <i>Provincial Letters</i> have a
conventional standing as orthodox compositions. It is strange, however,
that those who charge upon the satire of the later philosophers the
downfall of Catholicism in France should <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>not realize the plain
tendency of these brilliant satires to discredit the entire authority
of the Church, and, further, by their own dogmatic weaknesses, to put
all dogma alike under suspicion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9369src"
href="#xd21e9369" name="xd21e9369src">55</a> Few thoughtful men can now
read the <i lang="fr">Provinciales</i> without being impressed by the
utter absurdity of the problem over which the entire religious
intelligence of a great nation was engrossed.</p>
<p class="par">It was, in fact, the endless wrangles of the religious
factions over unintelligible issues that more than any other single
cause fostered the unbelief previously set up by religious
wars;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9393src" href="#xd21e9393" name=
"xd21e9393src">56</a> and Pascal&rsquo;s writings only deepened the
trouble. Even Bossuet, in his <i>History of the Variations of the
Protestant Churches</i> (1688), did but throw a new light on the
hollowness of the grounds of religion; and for thoughtful readers gave
a lead rather to atheism than to Catholicism. The converts it would
make to the Catholic Church would be precisely those whose adherence
was of least value, since they had not even the temperamental basis
which, rather than argument, kept Bossuet a believer, and were
Catholics only for lack of courage to put all religion aside. When
&ldquo;variation&rdquo; was put as a sign of error by a Churchman the
bulk of whose life was spent in bitter strifes with sections of his own
Church, critical people were hardly likely to be confirmed in the
faith. Within ten years of writing his book against the Protestants,
Bossuet was engaged in an acrid controversy with F&eacute;nelon, his
fellow prelate and fellow demonstrator of the existence and attributes
of God, accusing him of holding unchristian positions; and both
prelates were always fighting their fellow-churchmen the Jansenists. If
the variations of Protestants helped Catholicism, those of Catholics
must have helped unbelief.</p>
<p id="ch15.7" class="par">7. A similar fatality attended the labours
of the learned Huet, Bishop of Avranches, whose <i lang=
"la">Demonstratio Evangelica</i> (1678) is remarkable (with
Boyle&rsquo;s <i>Discourse of Things above Reason</i>) as anticipating
Berkeley in the argument from the arbitrariness of mathematical
assumptions. He too, by that and by his later works, made for sheer
philosophical skepticism,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9410src" href=
"#xd21e9410" name="xd21e9410src">57</a> always a dangerous basis for

attention, the more so seeing that it typifies a good deal of thinking
within the Catholic pale, on lines already noted as following on the
debate with Protestantism. Honestly pious by bent of mind, but always
occupied with processes of reasoning and research, Huet leant more and
more, as he grew in years, to the skeptical defence against the
pressures of Protestantism and rationalism, at once following and
furthering the tendency of his age. That the skeptical method is a last
weapon of defence can be seen from the temper in which the demonstrator
assails Spinoza, whom he abuses, without naming him, in the fashion of
his day, and to whose arguments concerning the authorship of the
Pentateuch he makes singularly feeble answers.<a class="noteref" id=

distinguished English critic, noting the general movement, pronounces,
justly enough, that Huet took up philosophy &ldquo;not as an end, but
as a means&mdash;not for its own sake, but for the support of
religion&rdquo;; and then adds that his attitude is thus quite
different from Pascal&rsquo;s.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9455src"
href="#xd21e9455" name="xd21e9455src">61</a> But the two cases are
really on a level. Pascal too was driven to philosophy in reaction
against incredulity; and though Pascal&rsquo;s work is of a more bitter
and morbid intensity, Huet also had in him that psychic craving for a
supernatural support which is the essence of latter-day religion. And
if we credit this spirit to Pascal and to Huet, as we do to Newman, we
must suppose that it partly touched the whole movement of pro-Catholic
skepticism which has been above noted as following on the Reformation.
It is ascribing to it as a whole too much of calculation and strategy
to say of its combatants that &ldquo;they conceived the desperate
design of first ruining the territory they were prepared to evacuate;
before philosophy was handed over to the philosophers the old
Aristotelean citadel was to be blown into the air.&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="par">Inasmuch too as Protestantism had no such ground, and
rationalism was still far from having cleared its bases, Huet, as
things went, was within his moral rights when he set forth his
transcendentalist skepticism in his <i lang="la">Qu&aelig;stiones

Latin,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9478src" href="#xd21e9478" name=
"xd21e9478src">64</a> that work attracted practically no attention; and
though, having a repute for provincialism in his French style, Huet was
loth to resort to the vernacular, he did devote his spare hours through
a number of his latter years to preparing his <i lang=
"fr">Trait&eacute; Philosophique de la faiblesse de l&rsquo;esprit
humain</i>, which, dying in 1722, he left to be published posthumously
(1723). The outcry against his criticism of Descartes and his <i lang=

but he was determined to leave a completed message. Thus it came about
that a sincere and devoted Catholic bishop &ldquo;left, as his last

less strictly propitious to science at some points than that of
Gassendi, was both directly and indirectly making for the activity of
reason. In virtue of its formal &ldquo;spiritualism,&rdquo; it found
access where any clearly materialistic doctrine would have been
tabooed; so that we find the Cartesian ecclesiastic R&eacute;gis not

After arousing a similar enthusiasm at Montpellier and at Paris,
R&eacute;gis was silenced by the Archbishop, whereupon he set himself
to develop the Cartesian philosophy in his study. The result was that

creation out of nothing,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9509src" href=

his doctrine of innate ideas with his God-idea, and on the other hand
headed the whole system towards pantheism. The tendency had arisen
before him in the congregation of the Oratory, to which he belonged,
and in which the Cartesian philosophy had so spread that when, in 1678,

&ldquo;Nevertheless, it was towards this chimera that Malebranche
tended.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9559src" href="#xd21e9559"
name="xd21e9559src">75</a> On all hands the new development set up new
strife; and Malebranche, who disliked controversy, found himself
embroiled alike with Jansenists and Jesuits, with orthodox and with
innovating Cartesians, and with his own Spinozistic disciples. The
Jansenist Arnauld attacked his book in a long and stringent treatise,
<i lang="fr">Des vrayes at des fausses id&eacute;es</i>
(1683),<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9568src" href="#xd21e9568" name=
"xd21e9568src">76</a> accumulating denials and contradictions with a
cold tenacity of ratiocination which never lapsed into passion, and was
all the more destructive. For the Jansenists Malebranche was a danger
to the faith in the ratio of his exaltation of it, inasmuch as
reference of the most ordinary beliefs back to &ldquo;faith&rdquo; left
them no ground upon which to argue up to faith.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9577src" href="#xd21e9577" name="xd21e9577src">77</a> This seems
to have been a common feeling among his readers. For the same reason he
made no appeal to men of science. He would have no recognition of
secondary causes, the acceptance of which he declared to be a dangerous
relapse into paganism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9582src" href=
"#xd21e9582" name="xd21e9582src">78</a> There was thus no scientific
principle in the new doctrine which could enable it to solve the
problems or absorb the systems of other schools. Locke was as little
moved by it as were the Jansenists. Malebranche won readers everywhere
by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>charm of style;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9593src" href="#xd21e9593" name="xd21e9593src">79</a> but he was
as much of a disturber as of a reconciler. The very controversies which
he set up made for disintegration; and F&eacute;nelon found it
necessary to &ldquo;refute&rdquo; Malebranche as well as Spinoza, and
did his censure with as great severity as Arnauld&rsquo;s.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9605src" href="#xd21e9605" name=
"xd21e9605src">80</a> The mere fact that Malebranche put aside miracles
in the name of divine law was fatal from the point of view of
orthodoxy.</p>
<p id="ch15.9" class="par">9. Yet another philosophic figure of the
reign of Louis XIV, the Jesuit P&egrave;re Buffier (1661&ndash;1737),
deserves a passing notice here&mdash;out of his chronological
order&mdash;though the historians of philosophy have mostly ignored
him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9610src" href="#xd21e9610" name=
"xd21e9610src">81</a> He is indeed of no permanent philosophic
importance, being a precursor of the Scottish school of Reid, nourished
on Locke, and somewhat on Descartes; but he is significant for the
element of practical rationalism which pervades his reasoning, and
which recommended him to Voltaire, Reid, and Destutt de Tracy. On the
question of &ldquo;primary truths in theology&rdquo; he declares so
boldly for the authority of revelation in all dogmas which pass
comprehension, and for the non-concern of theology with any process of
rational proof,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9616src" href="#xd21e9616"
name="xd21e9616src">82</a> that it is hardly possible to suppose him a
believer. On those principles, Islam has exactly the same authority as
Christianity. In his metaphysic &ldquo;he rejects all the ontological
proofs of the existence of God, and, among others, the proof of
Descartes from infinitude: he maintains that the idea of God is not
innate, and that it can be reached only from consideration of the order
of nature.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9621src" href="#xd21e9621"
name="xd21e9621src">83</a> He is thus as much of a force for deism as
was his master, Locke; and he outgoes him in point of rationalism when
he puts the primary ethic of reciprocity as a universally recognized
truth,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9627src" href="#xd21e9627" name=
"xd21e9627src">84</a> where Locke had helplessly fallen back on
&ldquo;the will of God.&rdquo; On the other hand he censures Descartes
for not admitting the equal validity of other tests with that of
primary consciousness, thus in effect putting himself in line with
Gassendi. For the rest, his <i lang="fr">Examen des
pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s vulgaires</i>, the most popular of his works, is
so full of practical rationalism, and declares among other things so
strongly in favour of free discussion, that its influence must have
been wholly in the direction of freethought. &ldquo;Give me,&rdquo; he
makes one of his disputants say, &ldquo;a nation where they do not
dispute, do not contest: it will be, I assure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>you,
a very stupid and a very ignorant nation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9638src" href="#xd21e9638" name="xd21e9638src">85</a> Such
reasoning could hardly please the Jesuits,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9643src" href="#xd21e9643" name="xd21e9643src">86</a> and must
have pleased freethinkers. And yet Buffier, like Gassendi, in virtue of
his clerical status and his purely professional orthodoxy, escaped all
persecution.</p>
<p class="par">While an evolving Cartesianism, modified by the thought
of Locke and the critical evolution of that, was thus reacting on
thought in all directions, the primary and proper impulse of Descartes
and Locke was doing on the Continent what that of Bacon had already
done in England&mdash;setting men on actual scientific observation and
experiment, and turning them from traditionalism of every kind. The
more religious minds, as Malebranche, set their faces almost
fanatically against erudition, thus making an enemy of the all-learned
Huet,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9653src" href="#xd21e9653" name=
"xd21e9653src">87</a> but on the other hand preparing the way for the
scientific age. For the rest we find the influence of Descartes at work
in heresies at which he had not hinted. Finally we shall see it taking
deep root in Holland, furthering a rationalistic view of the Bible and
of popular superstitions.</p>
<p id="ch15.10" class="par">10. Yet another new departure was made in
the France of Louis XIV by the scholarly performance of <span class=
"sc">Richard Simon</span> (1638&ndash;1712), who was as regards the
Scriptural texts what Spencer of Cambridge was as regards the
culture-history of the Hebrews, one of the founders of modern
methodical criticism. It was as a devout Catholic refuting Protestants,
and a champion of the Bible against Spinoza, that Simon began his work;
but, more sincerely critical than Huet, he reached views more akin to
those of Spinoza than to those of the Church.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9664src" href="#xd21e9664" name="xd21e9664src">88</a> The
congregation of the Oratory, where Simon laid the foundations of his
learning, was so little inclined to his critical views that he decided
to leave it; and though persuaded to stay, and to become for a time a
professor of philosophy at Julli, he at length broke with the Order.
Then, from his native town of Dieppe, came his strenuous series of
critical works&mdash;<i lang="fr">L&rsquo;histoire critique du Vieux
Testament</i> (1678), which among other things decisively impugned the
Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch; the <i lang="fr">Histoire critique
du texte du Nouveau Testament</i> (Rotterdam, 1689); numerous other
volumes of critical studies on texts, versions, and commentators; and
finally a French translation of the New Testament with notes. His
<i lang="fr">Biblioth&egrave;que Critique</i> (4 vols. under the name
of Saint-Jore) was suppressed by an order in council; the translation
was condemned by Bossuet and the Archbishop of Paris; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>and
the two first-named works were suppressed by the Parlement of Paris and
attacked by a host of orthodox scholars; but they were translated
promptly into Latin and English; and they gave a new breadth of footing
to the deistic argument, though Simon always wrote as an avowed
believer.</p>
<p class="par">Before Simon, the Protestant Isaac la Peyr&egrave;re,
the friend of La Mothe le Vayer and Gassendi, and the librarian of
Cond&eacute;, had fired a somewhat startling shot at the Pentateuch in
his <i lang="la">Pr&aelig;adamit&aelig;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9688src" href="#xd21e9688" name="xd21e9688src">89</a> and
<i lang="la">Systema Theologica ex Pr&aelig;-adamitarum Hypothesi</i>
(both 1655: printed in Holland<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9696src"
href="#xd21e9696" name="xd21e9696src">90</a>), for which he was
imprisoned at Brussels, with the result that he recanted and joined the
Church of Rome, going to the Pope in person to receive absolution, and
publishing an <i lang="la">Epistola ad Philotimum</i> (Frankfort,
1658), in which he professed to explain his reasons for abjuring at
once his Calvinism and his treatise. It is clear that all this was done
to save his skin, for there is explicit testimony that he held firmly
by his Preadamite doctrine to the end of his life, despite the seven or
eight confutations of his work published in 1656.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9708src" href="#xd21e9708" name="xd21e9708src">91</a> Were it not
for his constructive theses&mdash;especially his idea that Adam was a
real person, but simply the father of the Hebrews and not of the human
race&mdash;he would deserve to rank high among the scientific pioneers
of modern rationalism, for his negative work is shrewd and sound. Like
so many other early rationalists, collectively accused of
&ldquo;destroying without replacing,&rdquo; he erred precisely in his
eagerness to build up, for his negations have all become accepted
truths.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9727src" href="#xd21e9727" name=
"xd21e9727src">92</a> As it is, he may be ranked, after Toland, as a
main founder of the older rationalism, developed chiefly in Germany,
which sought to reduce as many miracles as possible to natural events
misunderstood. But he was too far before his time to win a fair
hearing. Where Simon laid a cautious scholarly foundation,
Peyr&egrave;re suddenly challenged immemorial beliefs, and failed
accordingly.</p>
<p id="ch15.11" class="par">11. Such an evolution could not occur in
France without affecting the neighbouring civilization of Holland. We
have seen Dutch life <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span>at the beginning of the seventeenth century
full of Protestant fanaticism and sectarian strife; and in the time of
Descartes these elements, especially on the Calvinist side, were strong
enough virtually to drive him out of Holland (1647) after nineteen
years&rsquo; residence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9741src" href=
"#xd21e9741" name="xd21e9741src">93</a> He had, however, made
disciples; and his doctrine bore fruit, finding doubtless some old soil
ready. Thus in 1666 one of his disciples, the Amsterdam physician Louis
Meyer, published a work entitled <i lang="la">Philosophia Sacrae
Scripturae Interpres</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9750src" href=
"#xd21e9750" name="xd21e9750src">94</a> in which, after formally
affirming that the Scripture is the infallible Word of God, he proceeds
to argue that the interpretation of the Word must be made by the human
reason, and accordingly sets aside all meanings which are
irreconcilable therewith, reducing them to allegories or tropes. Apart
from this, there is somewhat strong evidence that in Holland in the
second half of the century Cartesianism was in large part identified
with a widespread movement of rationalism, of a sufficiently pronounced
kind. Peter von Mastricht, Professor of Theology at Utrecht, published
in 1677 a Latin treatise, <i lang="la">Novitatum Cartesianarum
Gangr&aelig;na</i>, in which he made out a list of fifty-six
anti-Christian propositions maintained by Cartesians. Among them are
these: That the divine essence, also that of angels, and that of the
soul, consists only in Cogitation; That philosophy is not subservient
to divinity, and is no less certain and no less revealed; That in
things natural, moral, and practical, and also in matters of faith, the
Scripture speaks according to the erroneous notions of the vulgar; That
the mystery of the Trinity may be demonstrated by natural reason; That
the first chaos was able of itself to produce all things material; That
the world has a soul; and that it may be infinite in extent.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9766src" href="#xd21e9766" name=
"xd21e9766src">95</a> The theologian was thus visibly justified in
maintaining that the &ldquo;novelties&rdquo; of Cartesianism outwent by
a long way those of Arminianism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9772src"
href="#xd21e9772" name="xd21e9772src">96</a> It had in fact established

the supremacy ever accorded to it in the Church.<a class="noteref" id=

<p id="ch15.12" class="par">12. As Meyer was one of the most intimate
friends of Spinoza, being with him at death, and became the editor of
his posthumous works, it can hardly be doubted that his treatise, which
preceded Spinoza&rsquo;s <i lang="la">Tractatus</i> by four years,
influenced the great Jew, who speedily eclipsed him.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9789src" href="#xd21e9789" name="xd21e9789src">98</a>
<span class="sc">Spinoza</span>, however (1632&ndash;1677), was first
led <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=

teacher, Van den Ende, a scientific materialist, hostile to all
religion;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9797src" href="#xd21e9797" name=
"xd21e9797src">99</a> and it was while under his influence that he was
excommunicated by his father&rsquo;s synagogue. From the first,
apparently, Spinoza&rsquo;s thought was shaped partly by the medieval
Hebrew philosophy<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9813src" href="#xd21e9813"
name="xd21e9813src">100</a> (which, as we have seen, combined
Aristotelean and Saracen influences), partly by the teaching of Bruno,
though he modified and corrected that at various points.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9822src" href="#xd21e9822" name=
"xd21e9822src">101</a> Later he was deeply influenced by Descartes,
whom he specially expounded for a pupil in a tractate.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9834src" href="#xd21e9834" name=
"xd21e9834src">102</a> Here he endorses Descartes&rsquo;s doctrine of
freewill, which he was later to repudiate and overthrow. But he drew
from Descartes his retained principle that evil is not a real
existence. In a much less degree he was influenced by Bacon, whose
psychology he ultimately condemned; but from Hobbes he took not only
his rationalistic attitude towards &ldquo;revelation,&rdquo; but his
doctrine of ecclesiastical subordination.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9839src" href="#xd21e9839" name="xd21e9839src">103</a> Finally
evolving his own conceptions, he produced a philosophic system which
was destined to affect all European thought, remaining the while
quietly occupied with the handicraft of lens-grinding by which he
earned his livelihood. The Grand Pensionary of the Netherlands, John de
Witt, seems to have been in full sympathy with the young heretic, on
whom he conferred a small pension before he had published anything save
his Cartesian <i lang="la">Principia</i> (1663).</p>
<p class="par">The much more daring and powerful <i lang="la">Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus</i> (1670<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9850src"
href="#xd21e9850" name="xd21e9850src">104</a>) was promptly condemned
by a Dutch clerical synod, along with Hobbes&rsquo;s <i>Leviathan</i>,
which it greatly surpassed in the matter of criticism of the scriptural
text. It was the most stringent censure of supernaturalism that had
thus far appeared in any modern language; and its preface is an even
more mordant attack on popular religion and clericalism than the main
body of the work. What seems to-day an odd compromise&mdash;the
reservation of supra-rational authority for revelation, alongside of
unqualified claims for the freedom of reason<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9856src" href="#xd21e9856" name="xd21e9856src">105</a>&mdash;was
but an adaptation of the old scholastic formula of &ldquo;twofold
truth,&rdquo; and was perhaps at the time the possible maximum of open
rationalism in regard to the current creed, since both Bacon and Locke,
as we have seen, were fain to resort to it. As revealed in his letters,
Spinoza in almost all things stood at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>the point of view of
the cultivated rationalism of two centuries later. He believed in a

God&rsquo;s attributes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9876src" href=
"#xd21e9876" name="xd21e9876src">110</a> The <i>Tractatus</i> could not
go so far; but it went far enough to horrify many who counted
themselves latitudinarian. It was only in Holland that so aggressive a
criticism of Christian faith and practice could then appear; and even
there neither publisher nor author dared avow himself. Spinoza even
vetoed a translation into Dutch, foreseeing that such a book would be
placed under an interdict.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9883src" href=
"#xd21e9883" name="xd21e9883src">111</a> It was as much an appeal for
freedom of thought (<i lang="la">libertas philosophandi</i>) as a
demonstration of rational truth; and Spinoza dexterously pointed (c.
20) to the social effects of the religious liberty already enjoyed in
Amsterdam as a reason for carrying liberty further. There can be no
question that it powerfully furthered alike the deistic and the
Unitarian movements in England from the year of its appearance; and,
though the States-General felt bound formally to prohibit it on the
issue of the second edition in 1674, its effect in Holland was probably
as great as elsewhere: at least there seems to have gone on there from
this time a rapid modification of the old orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="par">Still more profound, probably, was the effect of the
posthumous <i>Ethica</i> (1677), which he had been prevented from
publishing in his lifetime,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9894src" href=
"#xd21e9894" name="xd21e9894src">112</a> and which not only propounded
in parts an absolute pantheism (= atheism<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9897src" href="#xd21e9897" name="xd21e9897src">113</a>), but
definitely grounded ethics in human nature. If more were needed to
arouse theological rage, it was to be found in the repeated and
insistent criticism of the moral and mental perversity of the defenders
of the faith<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9903src" href="#xd21e9903"
name="xd21e9903src">114</a>&mdash;a position not indeed quite
consistent with the primary teaching of the treatise on the subject of
Will, of which it denies the entity in the ordinary sense. Spinoza was
here reverting to the practical attitude of Bacon, which, under a
partial misconception, he had repudiated; and he did not formally solve
the contradiction. His purpose was to confute the ordinary orthodox
dogma that unbelief is wilful sin; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136"
href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>and to retort the charge
without reconciling it with the thesis was to impair the philosophic
argument.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9920src" href="#xd21e9920" name=
"xd21e9920src">115</a> It was not on that score, however, that it was

for by any words about the spirit of Christ.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9932src" href="#xd21e9932" name="xd21e9932src">116</a> The
discussion went deep and far. A reply to the <i>Tractatus</i> which
appeared in 1674, by an Utrecht professor (then dead), is spoken of by
Spinoza with contempt;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9938src" href=
"#xd21e9938" name="xd21e9938src">117</a> but abler discussion followed,
though the assailants mostly fell foul of each other. Franz Cuper or
Kuyper of Amsterdam, who in 1676 published an <i lang="la">Arcana
Atheismi Revelata</i>, professedly refuting Spinoza&rsquo;s
<i>Tractatus</i>, was charged with writing in bad faith and with being
on Spinoza&rsquo;s side&mdash;an accusation which he promptly retorted
on other critics, apparently with justice.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The able treatise of Prof. E. E. Powell on
<i>Spinoza and Religion</i> is open to demur at one point&mdash;its
reiterated dictum that Spinoza&rsquo;s character was marred by
&ldquo;lack of moral courage&rdquo; (p. 44). This expression is later
in a measure retreated from: after &ldquo;his habitual attitude of
timid caution,&rdquo; we have: &ldquo;Spinoza&rsquo;s timidity, or, if
you will, his peaceable disposition.&rdquo; If the last-cited
concession is to stand, the other phrases should be withdrawn. Moral
courage, like every other human attribute, is to be estimated
comparatively; and the test-question here is: Did any other writer in
Spinoza&rsquo;s day venture further than he? Moral courage is not
identical with the fanaticism which invites destruction; fanaticism
supplies a motive which dispenses with courage, though it operates as
courage might. But refusal to challenge destruction gratuitously does
not imply lack of courage, though of course it may be thereby motived.
A quite brave man, it has been noted, will quietly shun a gratuitous
risk where one who is &ldquo;afraid of being afraid&rdquo; may face it.
When all is said, Spinoza was one of the most daring writers of his
day; and his ethic made it no more a dereliction of duty for him to
avoid provoking arrest and capital punishment than it is for either a
Protestant or a rationalist to refrain from courting death by openly
defying Catholic beliefs before a Catholic mob in Spain. It is easy for
any of us to-day to be far more explicit than Spinoza was. It is
doubtful whether any of us, if we had lived in his day and were capable
of going as far in heresy, would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137"
href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>have run such risks as he did
in publishing the <i lang="la">Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</i>. For
those who have lived much in his society, it should be difficult to
doubt that, if allowed, he would have dared death on the night of the
mob-murder of the De Witts. The formerly suppressed proof of his very
plain speaking on the subject of prayer, and his indications of
aversion to the practice of grace before meals (Powell, pp.
323&ndash;25) show lack even of prudence on his part. Prof. Powell is
certainly entitled to censure those recent writers who have wilfully
kept up a mystification as to Spinoza&rsquo;s religiosity; but
<i>their</i> lack of courage or candour does not justify an imputation
of the same kind upon him. That Spinoza was &ldquo;no saint&rdquo;
(Powell, p. 43) is true in the remote sense that he was not incapable
of anger. But it would be hard to find a Christian who would compare
with him in general nobility of character. The proposition that he was
not &ldquo;in <i>any</i> sense religious&rdquo; (<i>id. ib.</i>) seems
open to verbal challenge.</p>

remained something of a Scripturalist, and refused to go the way of
Spinoza, he had courage enough to revive an ancient heresy by urging,
in his commentary on the fourth Gospel (1701), that &ldquo;the
Logos&rdquo; should be rendered &ldquo;Reason&rdquo;&mdash;an idea
which he probably derived from the Unitarian Zwicker without realizing
how far it could take him. His ultimate recantation, on the subject of
the authorship of the Pentateuch, served only to weaken his credit with
freethinkers, and came too late to arrest the intellectual movement
which he had forwarded.</p>
<p class="par">A rationalizing spirit had now begun to spread widely in

on scriptural grounds; Arnold Geulincx, of Leyden, and the French
Protestant refugee Daillon having less confidently put the view before
him, the latter in his <i>Daimonologia</i>, 1687 (trans. in English,
1723), and the former in his system of ethics. Gassendi, as we saw, had
notably discredited witchcraft a generation earlier; Reginald Scot had
impugned its actuality in 1584; and Wier, still earlier, in

Reformation the learned King Christian II of Denmark (deposed 1523) had
vetoed witch-burning in his dominions. (Allen, <i lang="fr">Hist. de

<i>Discoverie</i> had been translated into Dutch in 1609, Bekker
probably had a lead from him. Glanvill&rsquo;s <i>Blow at Modern
Sadducism</i> (1688), reproduced in <i>Sadducismus Triumphatus</i>,
undertakes to answer some objections of the kind later urged by Bekker;
and the discussion was practically international. Bekker&rsquo;s
treatise, entitled <i lang="nl">De Betooverte Wereld</i>, was
translated into English&mdash;first in 1695, from the French, under the
title <i>The World Bewitched</i> (only 1 vol. published), and again in
1700 as <i>The World turned upside down</i>. In the French translation,
<i lang="fr">Le Monde Enchant&eacute;</i> (4 tom. 1694), it had a great
vogue. A refutation was published in English in <i>An Historical
Treatise of Spirits</i>, by J. Beaumont, in 1705. It is noteworthy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=

<span class="sc">Pierre Bayle</span> (1647&ndash;1706), who, born in
France, but driven out by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, spent
the best part of his life and did his main work at Rotterdam.
Persecuted there for his freethinking, to the extent of having to give
up his professorship, he yet produced a virtual encyclopedia for
freethinkers in his incomparable Dictionary, baffling hostility by the
Pyrrhonian impartiality with which he handled all religious questions.
In his youth, when sent by his Protestant father to study at Toulouse,
he had been temporarily converted, as was the young Gibbon later, to
Catholicism;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10105src" href="#xd21e10105"
name="xd21e10105src">128</a> and the retrospect of that experience
seems in Bayle&rsquo;s case, as in Gibbon&rsquo;s, to have been a
permanent motive to practical skepticism.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10111src" href="#xd21e10111" name="xd21e10111src">129</a> But,
again, in the one case as in the other, skepticism was fortified by
abundant knowledge. Bayle had read everything and mastered every
controversy, and was thereby the better able to seem to have no
convictions of his own. But even apart from the notable defence of the
character of atheists dropped by him in the famous <i lang=
"fr">Pens&eacute;es diverses sur la Com&egrave;te</i> (1682), and in
the <i lang="fr">&Eacute;claircissements</i> in which he defended it,
it is abundantly evident that he was an unbeliever. The only
alternative view is that he was strictly or philosophically a skeptic,
reaching no conclusions for himself; but this is excluded by the whole
management of his expositions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10121src"
href="#xd21e10121" name="xd21e10121src">130</a> It is recorded that it
was his vehement description of himself as a Protestant &ldquo;in the
full force of the term,&rdquo; accompanied with a quotation from
Lucretius, that set the clerical diplomatist Polignac upon re-reading
the Roman atheist and writing his poem <i>Anti-Lucretius</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10136src" href="#xd21e10136" name=
"xd21e10136src">131</a> Bayle&rsquo;s ostensible Pyrrhonism was simply
the tactic forced on him by his conditions; and it was the positive
unbelievers who specially delighted in his volumes. He laid down no
cosmic doctrines, but he illuminated all; and his air of repudiating
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>such views as Spinoza&rsquo;s had the effect
rather of forcing Spinozists to leave neutral ground than of
rehabilitating orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="par">On one theme he spoke without any semblance of doubt.
Above all men who had yet written he is the champion of
toleration.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10151src" href="#xd21e10151"
name="xd21e10151src">132</a> At a time when in England the school of
Locke still held that atheism must not be tolerated, he would accept no
such position, insisting that error as such is not culpable, and that,
save in the case of a sect positively inciting to violence and
disorder, all punishment of opinion is irrational and unjust.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10173src" href="#xd21e10173" name=
"xd21e10173src">133</a> On this theme, moved by the memory of his own
life of exile and the atrocious persecution of the Protestants of
France, he lost his normal imperturbability, as in his Letter to an
Abb&eacute; (if it be really his), entitled <i lang="fr">Ce que
c&rsquo;est que la France toute catholique sous le r&egrave;gne de
Louis le Grand</i>, in which a controlled passion of accusation makes
every sentence bite like an acid, leaving a mark that no dialectic can
efface. But it was not only from Catholicism that he suffered, and not
only to Catholics that his message was addressed. One of his most
malignant enemies was the Protestant Jurieu, who it was that succeeded
in having him deprived of his chair of philosophy and history at
Rotterdam (1693) on the score of the freethinking of his <i lang=
"fr">Pens&eacute;es sur la Com&egrave;te</i>. This wrong cast a shadow
over his life, reducing him to financial straits in which he had to
curtail greatly the plan of his Dictionary. Further, it moved him to
some inconsistent censure of the political writings of French
Protestant refugees<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10187src" href=
"#xd21e10187" name="xd21e10187src">134</a>&mdash;Jurieu being the
reputed author of a violent attack on the rule of Louis XIV, under the
title <i lang="fr">Les Soupirs de la France esclave qui aspire

"xd21e10197src" href="#xd21e10197" name="xd21e10197src">135</a> Yet
again, the malicious Jurieu induced the Consistory of Rotterdam to
censure the Dictionary on the score of the tone and tendency of the
article &ldquo;David&rdquo; and the renewed vindications of
atheists.</p>
<p class="par">But nothing could turn Bayle from his loyalty to reason
and toleration; and the malice of the bigots could not deprive him of
his literary vogue, which was in the ratio of his unparalleled
industry. As a mere writer he is admirable: save in point of sheer wit,
of which, however, he has not a little, he is to this day as readable
as Voltaire. By force of unfailing lucidity, wisdom, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>knowledge, he made the conquest of literary
Europe; and fifty years after his death we find the Jesuit Delamare in
his (anonymous) apologetic treatise, <i lang="fr">La Foi
justifi&eacute;e de tout reproche de contradiction avec la raison</i>
(1761), speaking of him to the deists as &ldquo;their theologian, their
doctor, their oracle.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10213src" href=
"#xd21e10213" name="xd21e10213src">136</a> He was indeed no less; and
his serene exposure of the historic failure of Christianity was all the
more deadly as coming from a master of theological history.</p>
<p id="ch15.15" class="par">15. Meantime, Spinoza had reinforced the
critical movement in France,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10218src" href=
"#xd21e10218" name="xd21e10218src">137</a> where decline of belief can
be seen proceeding after as before the definite adoption of pietistic
courses by the king, under the influence of Madame de Maintenon.
Abbadie, writing his <i lang="fr">Trait&eacute; de la verit&eacute; de
la religion chr&eacute;tienne</i> at Berlin in 1684, speaks of an
&ldquo;infinity&rdquo; of prejudiced deists as against the
&ldquo;infinity&rdquo; of prejudiced believers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10230src" href="#xd21e10230" name=
"xd21e10230src">138</a>&mdash;evidently thinking of northern Europeans
in general; and he strives hard to refute both Hobbes and Spinoza on
points of Biblical criticism. In France he could not turn the tide.
That radical distrust of religious motives and illumination which can
be seen growing up in every country in modern Europe where religion led
to war, was bound to be strengthened by the spectacle of the reformed
sensualist harrying heresy in his own kingdom in the intervals of his
wars with his neighbours. The crowning folly of the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10233src" href="#xd21e10233"
name="xd21e10233src">139</a> (1685), forcing the flight from France of
some three hundred thousand industrious<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10239src" href="#xd21e10239" name="xd21e10239src">140</a> and
educated inhabitants for the offence of Protestantism, was as mad a
blow to religion as to the State. Less paralysing to economic life than
the similar policy of the Church against the Moriscoes in Spain, it is
no less striking a proof of the paralysis of practical judgment to
which unreasoning faith and systematic ecclesiasticism can lead.
Orthodoxy in France was as ecstatic in its praise of the act as had
been that of Spain in the case of the expulsion of the Moriscoes. The
deed is not to be laid at the single door of the king or of any of his
advisers, male or female: the act which deprived France of a vast host
of her soundest citizens was applauded by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Catholicism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10245src" href="#xd21e10245"

not merely the female devotees, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ry and
Madame Deshouli&egrave;res, but Racine, La Bruy&egrave;re, and the
senile la Fontaine&mdash;all extolled the senseless deed. The not
over-pious Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; was delighted with the
&ldquo;dragonnades,&rdquo; declaring that &ldquo;nothing could be
finer: no king has done or will do anything more memorable&rdquo;; the
still less mystical Bussy, author of the <i lang="fr">Histoire
amoureuse des Gaules</i>, was moved to pious exultation; and the dying
Chancelier le Tellier, on signing the edict of revocation, repeated the
legendary cry of Simeon, <i lang="la">Nunc dimitte servum tuum,
Domine!</i> To this pass had the Catholic creed and discipline brought
the mind of France. Only the men of affairs, nourished upon
realities&mdash;the Vaubans, Saint Simons, and Catinats&mdash;realized
the insanity of the action, which Colbert (d. 1683) would never have
allowed to come to birth.</p>
<p class="par">The triumphers, doubtless, did not contemplate the
expatriation of the myriads of Protestants who escaped over the
frontiers in the closing years of the century in spite of all the
efforts of the royal police, &ldquo;carrying with them,&rdquo; as a
later French historian writes, &ldquo;our arts, the secrets of our
manufactures, and their hatred of the king.&rdquo; The Catholics, as
deep in civics as in science, thought only of the humiliation and
subjection of the heretics&mdash;doubtless feeling that they were
getting a revenge against Protestantism for the Test Act and the
atrocities of the Popish Plot mania in England. The blow recoiled on
their country. Within a generation, their children were enduring the
agonies of utter defeat at the hands of a coalition of Protestant
nations every one of which had been strengthened by the piously exiled
sons of France; and in the midst of their mortal struggle the revolted
Protestants of the C&eacute;vennes so furiously assailed from the rear
that the drain upon the king&rsquo;s forces precipitated the loss of
their hold on Germany.</p>
<p class="par">For every Protestant who crossed the frontiers between
1685 and 1700, perhaps, a Catholic neared or crossed the line between
indifferentism and active doubt. The steady advance of science all the
while infallibly undermined faith; and hardly was the bolt launched
against the Protestants when new sapping and mining was going on.
<span class="sc">Fontenelle</span> (1657&ndash;1757), whose
<i>Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds</i> (1686) popularized for
the elegant world the new cosmology, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

undermined dogmatic faith in some directions; above all by his graceful
and skilful <i lang="fr">Histoire des Oracles</i> (also 1686), where
&ldquo;the argumentation passes beyond the thesis advanced. All that he
says of oracles could be said of miracles.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

Jesuits found the book essentially &ldquo;impious&rdquo;; and a French
culture-historian sees in it &ldquo;the first attack which directs the
scientific spirit against the foundations of Christianity. All the

in principle in the work of Fontenelle.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10286src" href="#xd21e10286" name="xd21e10286src">144</a> In his

established so well the determinist position that it was decisively
held by the majority of the French freethinkers who followed. Living to
his hundredth year, he could join hands with the freethought of
Gassendi and Voltaire,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10302src" href=
"#xd21e10302" name="xd21e10302src">146</a> Descartes and Diderot. Yet
we shall find him later, in his official capacity of censor of
literature, refusing to pass heretical books, on principles that would
have vetoed his own. He is in fact a type of the freethought of the age
of Louis XIV&mdash;Epicurean in the common sense, unheroic, resolute
only to evade penalties, guiltless of over-zeal. Not in that age could
men generate an enthusiasm for truth.</p>
<p id="ch15.16" class="par">16. Of the new Epicureans, the most famous

maintained both in London and in Paris, by his writings, a leadership
in polite letters. In England he greatly influenced young men like
Bolingbroke; and a translation (attributed to Dryden) of one of his
writings seems to have given Bishop Butler the provocation to the first

stress of debate set up by them. Even he, too, writes as a deist
against atheists, hardly as a believing Christian. If he were a
believer he certainly found no comfort in his faith: whatever were his
capacity for good feeling, no great writer of his age betrays such
bitterness of spirit, such suffering from the brutalities of life, such
utter disillusionment, such unfaith in men. And a certain doubt is cast
upon all his professions of opinion by the sombre avowal: &ldquo;A man

<p class="par first">M. Lanson remarks that &ldquo;we must not let
ourselves be abused by the last chapter [<i lang="fr">Des esprits

where La Bruy&egrave;re mingles Plato, Descartes, and Pascal in a vague
Christian spiritualism. This chapter, evidently sincere, but without
individuality, and containing only the reflex of the thoughts of
others, is not a conclusion to which the whole work conducts. It marks,
on the contrary, the lack of conclusion and of general views. What is
more, with the chapter <i>On the Sovereign</i>, placed in the middle of
the volume, it is destined to disarm the temporal and spiritual powers,
to serve as passport for the independent freedom of observation in the
rest of the <i lang="fr">Caract&egrave;res</i>&rdquo; (p. 599).</p>
<p class="par">On this it may be remarked that the essay in question is
not so much Christian as theistic; but the suggestion as to the object
is plausible. Taine (<i lang="fr">Essais de critique et
d&rsquo;histoire</i>, ed. 1901) first remarks (p. 11) on the
&ldquo;christianisme&rdquo; of the essay, and then decides (p. 12) that
&ldquo;he merely exposes in brief and imperious style the reasonings of
the school of Descartes.&rdquo; It should be noted, however, that in
this essay La Bruy&egrave;re does not scruple to write: &ldquo;If all
religion is a respectful fear of God, what is to be thought of those
who dare to wound him in his most living image, which is the
sovereign?&rdquo; (&sect; 27 in ed. Walckenaer, p. 578. Pascal holds
the same tone. <i lang="fr">Vie</i>, par Madame Perier.) This appears
first in the fourth edition; and many other passages were inserted in
that and later issues: the whole is an inharmonious mosaic.</p>
<p class="par">Concerning La Bruy&egrave;re, the truth would seem to be
that the inconsequences in the structure of his essays were symptomatic
of variability in his moods and opinions. Taine and Lanson are struck
by the premonitions of the revolution in his famous picture of the
peasants, and other passages; and the latter remarks (p. 603) that
&ldquo;the points touched by La Bruy&egrave;re are precisely those
where the writers of the next age undermined <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>the
old order: La Bruy&egrave;re is already <i lang="fr">philosophe</i> in
the sense which Voltaire and Diderot gave to that term.&rdquo; But we
cannot be sure that the plunges into convention were not real swervings
of a vacillating spirit. It is difficult otherwise to explain his
recorded approbation of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="fr">Dialogues sur le Qui&eacute;tisme</i>,
published posthumously under his name (1699), appear to be spurious.
This was emphatically asserted by contemporaries (<i lang=

other points were in opposition. Baron Walckenaer (<i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;tude</i>, ed. cited, p. 76 <i>sq.</i>) pronounces that
they were the work of Elli&egrave;s du Pin, a doctor of the Sorbonne,
and gives good reasons for the attribution. The Abb&eacute;
d&rsquo;Olivet in his <i lang="fr">Histoire de l&rsquo;Acad&eacute;mie
fran&ccedil;aise</i> declares that La Bruy&egrave;re only drafted them,
and that du Pin edited them; but the internal evidence is against their
containing anything of La Bruy&egrave;re&rsquo;s draught. They are
indeed so feeble that no admirer cares to accept them as his. (Cp. note
to Suard&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Notice sur la personne et les

<p class="par">If the apologetics of Huet and Pascal, Bossuet and

but in the direction of making it more circumspect, never of driving it
out. It is significant that whereas in the year of the issue of the
<i lang="la">Demonstratio</i> the Duchesse d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans could
write that &ldquo;every young man either is or affects to be an

advantage of those who can raise themselves above the <i>prejudices</i>
of education and of the society in which one is born. Pyrrhonism is the

&lsquo;not believing lightly&rsquo; and in being &lsquo;ready to
doubt.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10426src" href=
"#xd21e10426" name="xd21e10426src">153</a> Pascal and Huet between them
had only multiplied doubters. On both lines, obviously, freethought was
the gainer; and in a Jesuit treatise, <i lang="fr">Le Monde
condamn&eacute; par luymesme</i>, published in 1695, the <i lang=
"fr">Pr&eacute;face contre l&rsquo;incr&eacute;dulit&eacute; des
libertins</i> sets out with the avowal that &ldquo;to draw the
condemnation of the world out of its own mouth, it is necessary to
attack first the incredulity of the unbelievers (<i lang=
"fr">libertins</i>), who compose the main part of it, and who under
some appearance of Christianity conceal a mind either Judaic [read
<i>deistic</i>] or pagan.&rdquo; Such was France to a religious eye at
the height of the Catholic triumph over Protestantism. The statement
that the <i lang="fr">libertins</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>formed the majority
of &ldquo;the world&rdquo; is of course a furious extravagance. But
there must have been a good deal of unbelief to have moved a priest to
such an explosion. And the unbelief must have been as much a product of
revulsion from religious savagery as a result of direct critical
impulse, for there was as yet no circulation of positively freethinking
literature. For a time, indeed, there was a general falling away in
French intellectual prestige,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10453src"
href="#xd21e10453" name="xd21e10453src">154</a> the result, not of the
mere &ldquo;protective spirit&rdquo; in literature, as is sometimes
argued, but of the immense diversion of national energy under Louis XIV
to militarism;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10459src" href="#xd21e10459"
name="xd21e10459src">155</a> and the freethinkers lost some of the
confidence as well as some of the competence they had exhibited in the
days of Moli&egrave;re.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10471src" href=
"#xd21e10471" name="xd21e10471src">156</a> There had been too little
solid thinking done to preclude a reaction when the king, led by Madame
de Maintenon, went about to atone for his debaucheries by an old age of
piety. &ldquo;The king had been put in such fear of hell that he
believed that all who had not been instructed by the Jesuits were
damned. To ruin anyone it was necessary only to say, &lsquo;He is a
Huguenot, or a Jansenist,&rsquo; and the thing was
done.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10474src" href="#xd21e10474"
name="xd21e10474src">157</a> In this state of things there spread in
France the revived doctrine or temper of Quietism, set up by the
Spanish priest, Miguel de Molinos (1640&ndash;1697), whose <i>Spiritual
Guide</i>, published in Spanish in 1675, appeared in 1681 in Italian at
Rome, where he was a highly influential confessor. It was soon
translated into Latin, French, and Dutch. In 1685 he was cited before
the Inquisition; in 1687 the book was condemned to be burned, and he
was compelled to retract sixty-eight propositions declared to be
heretical; whereafter, nonetheless, he was imprisoned till his death in
1696. In France, whence the attack on him had begun, his teaching made
many converts, notably Madame Guyon, and may be said to have created a
measure of religious revival. But when F&eacute;nelon took it up
(1697), modifying the terminology of Molinos to evade the official
condemnation, he was bitterly attacked by Bossuet as putting forth
doctrine incompatible with Christianity; the prelates fought for two
years; and finally the Pope condemned F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s book,
whereupon he submitted, limiting his polemic to attacks on the
Jansenists. Thus the gloomy orthodoxy of the court and the mysticism of
the new school alike failed to affect the general intelligence; there
was no real building up of belief; and the forward movement at length
recommenced. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=

&ldquo;Spinozism is atheistic, and has no valid ground for retaining
the word &lsquo;God&rsquo;&rdquo; (Martineau, p. 349). This estimate is
systematically made good by Prof. E. E. Powell of Miami University in
his <i>Spinoza and Religion</i> (1906). See in particular ch. v. The
summing-up is that &ldquo;the right name for Spinoza&rsquo;s philosophy
is Atheistic Monism&rdquo; (pp. 339&ndash;40).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

solution is, of course, that the attitude of the will in the forming of
opinion may or may not be passionally perverse, in the sense of being
inconsistent. To show that it is inconsistent <i>may</i> be a means of
enlightening it; and an aspersion to that effect <i>may</i> be
medicinal. Spinoza might truly have said that passional perversity was
at least as common on the orthodox side as on the other. In any case,
he quashes his own criticism of Bacon. Cp. the author&rsquo;s essay on

destruction of Protestant liberties was not the work of the single Act

withholding of court favour it proceeded to subsidies for conversions,
and thence to a graduated series of invasions of Protestant rights, so
that the formal Revocation was only the violent consummation of a
process. See the recital in Bonet-Maury, <i lang="fr">Histoire de la

<p class="par first">It appears from our survey that the &ldquo;deistic
movement,&rdquo; commonly assigned to the eighteenth century, had been
abundantly prepared for in the seventeenth, which, in turn, was but
developing ideas current in the sixteenth. When, in 1696, <span class=
"sc">John Toland</span> published his <i>Christianity Not
Mysterious</i>, the sensation it made was due not so much to any
unheard-of boldness in its thought as to the simple fact that deistic
ideas had thus found their way into print.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10506src" href="#xd21e10506" name="xd21e10506src">1</a> So far
the deistic position was explicitly represented in English literature
only by the works of Herbert, Hobbes, and Blount; and of these only the
first (who wrote in Latin) and the third had put the case at any
length. Against the deists or atheists of the school of Hobbes, and the
Scriptural Unitarians who thought with Newton and Locke, there stood
arrayed the great mass of orthodox intolerance which clamoured for the
violent suppression of every sort of &ldquo;infidelity.&rdquo; It was
this feeling, of which the army of ignorant rural clergy were the
spokesmen, that found vent in the Blasphemy Act of 1697. The new
literary growth dating from the time of Toland is the evidence of the
richness of the rationalistic soil already created. Thinking men craved
a new atmosphere. Locke&rsquo;s <i>Reasonableness of Christianity</i>
is an unsuccessful compromise: Toland&rsquo;s book begins a new
propagandist era.</p>
<p class="par">Toland&rsquo;s treatise,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10514src" href="#xd21e10514" name="xd21e10514src">2</a> heretical
as it was, professed to be a defence of the faith, and avowedly founded
on Locke&rsquo;s anonymous <i>Reasonableness of Christianity</i>, its
young author being on terms of acquaintance with the
philosopher.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10520src" href="#xd21e10520"
name="xd21e10520src">3</a> He claimed, in fact, to take for granted
&ldquo;the Divinity of the New Testament,&rdquo; and to
&ldquo;demonstrate the verity of divine revelation against atheists and
all enemies of revealed religion,&rdquo; from whom, accordingly, he
expected to receive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148"
name="pb148">148</a>]</span>no quarter. Brought up, as he declared,
&ldquo;from my cradle, in the grossest superstition and
idolatry,&rdquo; he had been divinely led to make use of his own
reason; and he assured his Christian readers of his perfect sincerity
in &ldquo;defending the true religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10528src" href="#xd21e10528" name="xd21e10528src">4</a> Twenty
years later, his primary positions were hardly to be distinguished from
those of ratiocinative champions of the creed, save in respect that he
was challenging orthodoxy where they were replying to unbelievers.
Toland, however, lacked alike the timidity and the prudence which so
safely guided Locke in his latter years; and though his argument was
only a logical and outspoken extension of Locke&rsquo;s position, to
the end of showing that there was nothing supra-rational in
Christianity of Locke&rsquo;s type, it separated him from
&ldquo;respectable&rdquo; society in England and Ireland for the rest
of his life. The book was &ldquo;presented&rdquo; by the Grand Juries
of Middlesex and Dublin;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10532src" href=
"#xd21e10532" name="xd21e10532src">5</a> the dissenters in Dublin being
chiefly active in denouncing it&mdash;with or without knowledge of its
contents;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10538src" href="#xd21e10538" name=
"xd21e10538src">6</a> half-a-dozen answers appeared; and when in 1698
Toland produced another, entitled <i>Amyntor</i>, showing the infirm
foundation of the Christian canon, there was again a speedy crop of
replies. Despite the oversights inevitable to such pioneer work, this
opens, from the side of freethought, the era of documentary criticism
of the New Testament; and in some of his later freethinking books, as
the <i>Nazarenus</i> (1718) and the <i>Pantheisticon</i> (1720), he
continues to show himself in advance of his time in &ldquo;opening new
windows&rdquo; for his mind.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10553src" href=
"#xd21e10553" name="xd21e10553src">7</a> The latter work represents in
particular the influence of Spinoza, whom he had formerly criticized
somewhat forcibly<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10563src" href=
"#xd21e10563" name="xd21e10563src">8</a> for his failure to recognize
that motion is inherent in matter. On that head he lays down<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10569src" href="#xd21e10569" name=
"xd21e10569src">9</a> the doctrine that &ldquo;motion is but matter
under a certain consideration&rdquo;&mdash;an essentially
&ldquo;materialist&rdquo; position, deriving from the pre-Socratic
Greeks, and incidentally affirmed by Bacon.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10574src" href="#xd21e10574" name="xd21e10574src">10</a> He was
not exactly an industrious student or writer; but he had scholarly
knowledge and instinct, and several of his works show close study of
Bayle.</p>
<p class="par">As regards his more original views on Christian origins,
he is not impressive to the modern reader; but theses which to-day
stand for little were in their own day important. Thus in his
<i>Hodegus</i> (pt. i <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>of the <i>Tetradymus</i>, 1720) it
is elaborately argued that the &ldquo;pillar of fire by night and of
cloud by day&rdquo; was no miracle, but the regular procedure of guides
in deserts, where night marches are the rule; the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;
being simply the smoke of the vanguard&rsquo;s fire, which by night
flared red. Later criticism decides that the whole narrative of the
Exodus is myth. Toland&rsquo;s method, however, was relatively so
advanced that it had not been abandoned by theological
&ldquo;rationalists&rdquo; a century later. Of that movement he must be
ranked an energetic pioneer: though he lacked somewhat the strength of
character that in his day was peculiarly needed to sustain a
freethinker. Much of his later life was spent abroad; and his
<i>Letters to Serena</i> (1704) show him permitted to discourse to the
Queen of Prussia on such topics as the origin and force of prejudice,
the history of the doctrine of immortality, and the origin of idolatry.
He pays his correspondent the compliment of treating his topics with
much learning; and his manner of assuming her own orthodoxy in regard
to revelation could have served as a model to Gibbon.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10592src" href="#xd21e10592" name="xd21e10592src">11</a> But,
despite such distinguished patronage, his life was largely passed in
poverty, cheerfully endured,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10598src" href=
"#xd21e10598" name="xd21e10598src">12</a> with only chronic help from
well-to-do sympathizers, such as Shaftesbury, who was not
over-sympathetic. When it is noted that down to 1761 there had appeared
no fewer than fifty-four answers to his first book,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10604src" href="#xd21e10604" name="xd21e10604src">13</a> his
importance as an intellectual influence may be realized.</p>
<p class="par">A certain amount of evasion was forced upon Toland by
the Blasphemy Law of 1697; inferentially, however, he was a thorough
deist until he became pantheist; and the discussion over his books
showed that views essentially deistic were held even among his
antagonists. One, an Irish bishop, got into trouble by setting forth a
notion of deity which squared with that of Hobbes.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10612src" href="#xd21e10612" name="xd21e10612src">14</a> The
whole of our present subject, indeed, is much complicated by the
distribution of heretical views among the nominally orthodox, and of
orthodox views among heretics.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10615src"
href="#xd21e10615" name="xd21e10615src">15</a> Thus the school of
Cudworth, zealous against atheism, was less truly theistic than that of
Blount,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10618src" href="#xd21e10618" name=
"xd21e10618src">16</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>who, following Hobbes, pointed out
that to deny to God a continual personal and providential control of
human affairs was to hold to atheism under the name of theism;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10638src" href="#xd21e10638" name=
"xd21e10638src">17</a> whereas Cudworth, the champion of theism against
the atheists, entangled himself hopelessly<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10642src" href="#xd21e10642" name="xd21e10642src">18</a> in a
theory which made deity endow Nature with &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; powers
and leave it to its own evolution. The position was serenely demolished
by Bayle,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10648src" href="#xd21e10648" name=
"xd21e10648src">19</a> as against Le Clerc, who sought to defend it;
and in England the clerical outcry was so general that Cudworth gave up
authorship.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10656src" href="#xd21e10656"
name="xd21e10656src">20</a> Over the same crux, in Ireland, Bishop
Browne and Bishop Berkeley accused each other of promoting atheism; and
Archbishop King was embroiled in the dispute.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10662src" href="#xd21e10662" name="xd21e10662src">21</a> On the
other hand, the theistic Descartes had laid down a
&ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; theory of the universe which perfectly
comported with atheism, and partly promoted that way of
thinking;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10668src" href="#xd21e10668" name=
"xd21e10668src">22</a> and a selection from Gassendi&rsquo;s ethical
writings, translated into English<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10677src"
href="#xd21e10677" name="xd21e10677src">23</a> (1699), wrought in the
same direction. The Church itself contained Cartesians and
Cudworthians, Socinians and deists.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10684src" href="#xd21e10684" name="xd21e10684src">24</a> Each

id="xd21e10690src" href="#xd21e10690" name="xd21e10690src">25</a> and
Providence; and the theistic schools of Newton, Clarke, and Leibnitz
rejected each other&rsquo;s philosophies as well as that of Descartes.
Leibnitz complained grimly that Newton and his followers had &ldquo;a
very odd opinion concerning the Work of God,&rdquo; making the universe
an imperfect machine, which the deity had frequently to mend; and
treating space as an organ by which God perceives things, which are
thus regarded as not produced or maintained by him.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10693src" href="#xd21e10693" name="xd21e10693src">26</a>
Newton&rsquo;s principles of explanation, he insisted, were those of
the materialists.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10696src" href=
"#xd21e10696" name="xd21e10696src">27</a> John Hutchinson, a professor
at Cambridge, in his <i>Treatise of Power, Essential and
Mechanical</i>, also bitterly assailed Newton as a deistical and
anti-scriptural sophist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10702src" href=
"#xd21e10702" name="xd21e10702src">28</a> Clarke, on the other hand,
declared that the philosophy of Leibnitz was &ldquo;tending to banish
God from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=

"xd21e10710src" href="#xd21e10710" name="xd21e10710src">29</a>
Alongside of such internecine strife, it was not surprising that the
great astronomer Halley, who accepted Newton&rsquo;s principles in
physics, was commonly reputed an atheist; and that the freethinkers
pitted his name in that connection against Newton&rsquo;s.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10716src" href="#xd21e10716" name=
"xd21e10716src">30</a> As it was he who first suggested<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10725src" href="#xd21e10725" name=
"xd21e10725src">31</a> the idea of the total motion of the entire solar
system in space&mdash;described by a modern pietist as &ldquo;this
great cosmical truth, the grandest in astronomy&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10731src" href="#xd21e10731" name=
"xd21e10731src">32</a>&mdash;they were not ill justified. It can hardly
be doubted that if intellectual England could have been polled in 1710,
under no restraints from economic, social, and legal pressure, some
form of rationalism inconsistent with Christianity would have been
found to be nearly as common as orthodoxy. In outlying provinces, in
Devon and Cornwall, in Ulster, in Edinburgh and Glasgow, as well as in
the metropolis, the pressure of deism on the popular creed evoked
expressions of Arian and Socinian thought among the clergy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10737src" href="#xd21e10737" name=
"xd21e10737src">33</a> It was, in fact, the various restraints under
notice that determined the outward fortunes of belief and unbelief, and
have substantially determined them since. When the devout Whiston was
deposed from his professorship for his Arianism, and the unbelieving
Saunderson was put in his place,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10744src"
href="#xd21e10744" name="xd21e10744src">34</a> and when Simson was
suspended from his ministerial functions in Glasgow,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10750src" href="#xd21e10750" name="xd21e10750src">35</a> the
lesson was learned that outward conformity was the sufficient way to
income.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10762src" href="#xd21e10762" name=
"xd21e10762src">36</a></p>
<p class="par">Hard as it was, however, to kick against the pricks of
law and prejudice, it is clear that many in the upper and middle
classes privately did so. The clerical and the new popular literature
of the time prove this abundantly. In the <i>Tatler</i> and its
successors,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10773src" href="#xd21e10773"
name="xd21e10773src">37</a> the decorous Addison and the indecorous
Steele, neither of them a competent thinker, frigidly or furiously
asperse the new tribe of freethinkers; while the evangelically pious
Berkeley and the extremely unevangelical Swift rival each other in the
malice of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>their attacks on those who rejected their creed.
Berkeley, a man of philosophic genius but intense prepossessions,
maintained Christianity on grounds which are the negation of
philosophy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10789src" href="#xd21e10789"
name="xd21e10789src">38</a> Swift, the genius of neurotic misanthropy,
who, in the words of Macaulay, &ldquo;though he had no religion, had a
great deal of professional spirit,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10800src" href="#xd21e10800" name="xd21e10800src">39</a> fought
venomously for the creed of salvation. And still the deists multiplied.
In the <span class="sc">Earl of Shaftesbury</span><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10809src" href="#xd21e10809" name="xd21e10809src">40</a> they
had a satirist with a finer and keener weapon than was wielded by
either Steele or Addison, and a much better temper than was owned by
Swift or Berkeley. He did not venture to parade his unbelief: to do so
was positively dangerous; but his thrusts at faith left little doubt as
to his theory. He was at once dealt with by the orthodox as an enemy,
and as promptly adopted by the deists as a champion, important no less
for his ability than for his rank. Nor, indeed, is he lacking in
boldness in comparison with contemporary writers. The anonymous
pamphlet entitled <i>The Natural History of Superstition</i>, by the
deist John Trenchard, M.P. (1709), does not venture on overt heresy.
But Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <i>Letter Concerning Enthusiasm</i> (1708), his
<i>Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour</i> (1709), and his treatise
<i>The Moralists</i> (1709), had need be anonymous because of their
essential hostility to the reigning religious ethic.</p>
<p class="par">Such polemic marks a new stage in rationalistic
propaganda. Swift, writing in 1709, angrily proposes to &ldquo;prevent
the publishing of such pernicious works as under pretence of
freethinking endeavour to overthrow those tenets in religion which have
been held inviolable in almost all ages.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10835src" href="#xd21e10835" name="xd21e10835src">41</a> But his
further protest that &ldquo;the doctrine of the Trinity, the divinity
of Christ, the immortality of the soul, and even the truth of all
revelation, are daily exploded and denied in books openly
printed,&rdquo; points mainly to the Unitarian propaganda. Among
freethinkers he names, in his <i>Argument Against Abolishing
Christianity</i> (1708), Asgill, Coward, Toland, and Tindal. But the
first was an ultra-Christian; the second was a Christian upholder of
the thesis that spirit is not immaterial; and the last, at that date,
had published only his <i>Four Discourses</i> (collected in 1709) and
his <i>Rights of the Christian Church</i>, which are anti-clerical, but
not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=

1673 published <i>Two Letters of Advice, I, For the Susception of Holy
Orders; II, For Studies Theological, especially such as are
Rational</i>, and in 1706 an <i>Epistolary Discourse Concerning the
Soul&rsquo;s Natural Mortality</i>, maintaining the doctrine of

<p class="par">An official picture of the situation is formally drawn
in <i>A Representation of the Present State of Religion, with regard to
the late excessive growth of infidelity, heresy, and profaneness</i>,
drawn up by the Upper House of Convocation of the province of
Canterbury in 1711.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10898src" href=
"#xd21e10898" name="xd21e10898src">46</a> This sets forth, as a result
of the disorders of the Rebellion, a growth of all manner of unbelief
and profanity, including denial of inspiration and the authority of the
canon; the likening of Christian miracles to heathen fables; the
treating of all religious mysteries as absurd speculations; Arianism
and Socinianism and scoffing at the doctrine of the Trinity; denial of
natural immortality; Erastianism; mockery of baptism and the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper; decrying of all priests as impostors; the
collecting and reprinting of infidel works; and publication of mock
catechisms. It is explained that all such printing has greatly
increased &ldquo;since the expiration of the Act for restraining the
press&rdquo;; and mention is made of an Arian work just published to
which the author has put his name, and which he has dedicated to the
Convocation itself. This was the first volume of Whiston&rsquo;s
<i>Primitive Christianity Revived</i>, the work of a devout eccentric,
who had just before been deprived of his professorship at Cambridge for
his orally avowed heresy. Whiston, whose cause was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=

lampooned, in an indecorous but vigorous sketch, <i>The Tryal of
William Whiston, Clerk, for defaming and denying the Holy Trinity,
before the Lord Chief Justice Reason</i> (1712; 3rd ed. 1740), always
remained perfectly devout in his Arian orthodoxy; but his and his
friends&rsquo; arguments were rather better fitted to make deists than
to persuade Christians; and Convocation&rsquo;s appeal for a new Act
&ldquo;restraining the present excessive and scandalous liberty of
printing wicked books at home, and importing the like from
abroad&rdquo; was not responded to. There was no love lost between
Bolingbroke and Shaftesbury; but the government in which the former, a
known deist, was Secretary of State, could hardly undertake to suppress
the works of the latter.</p>

Collins</span> (1676&ndash;1729) began a new development by his
<i>Discourse of Freethinking</i>. He had previously published a notably
freethinking <i>Essay Concerning the Use of Reason</i> (1707), albeit
without specific impeachment of the reigning creed; carried on a
discussion with Clarke on the question of the immateriality of the
soul; and issued treatises entitled <i>Priestcraft in Perfection</i>
(1709, dealing with the history of the Thirty-nine Articles)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10945src" href="#xd21e10945" name=
"xd21e10945src">48</a> and <i>A Vindication of the Divine
Attributes</i> (1710), exposing the Hobbesian theism of Archbishop King
on lines followed twenty years later by Berkeley in his <i>Minute
Philosopher</i>. But none of these works aroused such a tumult as the
<i>Discourse of Freethinking</i>, which may be said to sum up and unify
the drift not only of previous English freethinking, but of the great
contribution of Bayle, whose learning and temper influence all English
deism from Shaftesbury onwards.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10976src"
href="#xd21e10976" name="xd21e10976src">49</a> Collins&rsquo;s book,
however, was unique in its outspokenness. To the reader of to-day,
indeed, it is no very aggressive performance: the writer was a man of
imperturbable amenity and genuine kindliness of nature; and his style
is the completest possible contrast to that of the furious replies it
elicited. It was to Collins that Locke wrote, in 1703: &ldquo;Believe
it, my good friend, to love truth for truth&rsquo;s sake is the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>principal part of human perfection in this
world, and the seed-plot of all other virtues; and, if I mistake not,
you have as much of it as I ever met with in anybody.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10982src" href="#xd21e10982" name=
"xd21e10982src">50</a> The <i>Discourse</i> does no discredit to this
uncommon encomium, being a luminous and learned plea for the conditions
under which alone truth can be prosperously studied, and the habits of
mind which alone can attain it. Of the many replies, the most notorious
is that of Bentley writing as <i>Phileleutherus Lipsiensis</i>, a
performance which, on the strength of its author&rsquo;s reputation for
scholarship, has been uncritically applauded by not a few critics, of
whom some of the most eminent do not appear to have read
Collins&rsquo;s treatise.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10993src" href=
"#xd21e10993" name="xd21e10993src">51</a> Bentley&rsquo;s is in reality
pre-eminent only for insolence and bad faith, the latter complicated by
lapses of scholarship hardly credible on its author&rsquo;s part.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">See the details in <i>Dynamics of Religion</i>,
ch. vii. I am compelled to call attention to the uncritical verdict
given on this matter by the late Sir Leslie Stephen, who asserts
(<i>English Thought</i>, i, 206) that Bentley convicts Collins of
&ldquo;unworthy shuffling&rdquo; in respect of his claim that
freethinking had &ldquo;banished the devil.&rdquo; Bentley affirmed
that this had been the work, not of the freethinkers, but of &ldquo;the
Royal Society, the Boyles and the Newtons&rdquo;; and Sir Leslie
comments that &ldquo;nothing could be more true.&rdquo; Nothing could
be more untrue. As we have seen (above p. 82), Boyle was a convinced
believer in demonology; and Newton did absolutely nothing to disperse
it. Glanvill, a Royal Society man, had been a vehement supporter of the
belief in witchcraft; and the Society as such never meddled with the
matter. As to Collins&rsquo;s claim for the virtue of freethinking, Sir
Leslie strangely misses the point that Collins meant by the word not
unbelief, but free inquiry. He could not have meant to say that Holland
was full of deists. In Collins&rsquo;s sense of the word, the Royal
Society&rsquo;s work in general was freethinking work.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">One mistranslation which appears to have been a
printer&rsquo;s error, and one mis-spelling of a Greek name, are the
only heads on which Bentley confutes his author. He had, in fact,
neither the kind of knowledge nor the candour that could fit him to
handle the problems raised. It was Bentley&rsquo;s cue to represent
Collins as an atheist, though he was a very pronounced deist;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11010src" href="#xd21e11010" name=
"xd21e11010src">52</a> and in the first uproar <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=

avoid arrest.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11027src" href="#xd21e11027"
name="xd21e11027src">53</a> But deism was too general to permit of such
a representative being exiled; and he returned to study quietly,
leaving Bentley&rsquo;s vituperation and prevarication unanswered, with
the other attacks made upon him. In 1715 he published his brief but
masterly <i>Inquiry Concerning Human Liberty</i>&mdash;anonymous, like
all his works&mdash;which remains unsurpassed as a statement of the
case for Determinism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11036src" href=
"#xd21e11036" name="xd21e11036src">54</a></p>
<p class="par">The welcome given to Bentley&rsquo;s attack upon Collins
by the orthodox was warm in proportion to their sense of the general
inadequacy of the apologetics on their side. Amid the common swarm of
voluble futilities put forth by Churchmen, the strident vehemence as
well as the erudite repute of the old scholar were fitted at least to
attract the attention of lay readers in general. Most of the
contemporary vindications of the faith, however, were fitted only to
move intelligent men to new doubt or mere contempt. A sample of the
current defence against deism is the treatise of Joseph Smith on <i>The
Unreasonableness of Deism, or, the Certainty of a Divine
Revelation</i>, etc. 1720, where deists in general are called
&ldquo;the Wicked and Unhappy men we have to deal with&rdquo;:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11050src" href="#xd21e11050" name=
"xd21e11050src">55</a> and the argumentation consists in alleging that
a good God must reveal himself, and that if the miracle stories of the
New Testament had been false the Jews would have exposed and discarded
them. Against such nugatory traditionalism, the criticism of Collins
shone with the spirit of science. Not till 1723 did he publish his next
work, <i>A Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian
Religion</i>, a weighty attack on the argument from prophecy, to which
the replies numbered thirty-five; on which followed in 1727 his
<i>Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered</i>, a reply to criticisms.
The former work was pronounced by Warburton one of the most plausible
ever written against Christianity, and he might well say so. It faced
the argument from prophecy not merely with the skepticism of the
ordinary deist, but with that weapon of critical analysis of which the
use had been briefly shown by Hobbes and Spinoza. Apparently for the
first time, he pointed out that the &ldquo;virgin prophecy&rdquo; in
Isaiah had a plain reference to contemporary and not to future events;
he showed that the &ldquo;out of Egypt&rdquo; prophecy referred to the
Hebrew past; and he revived the ancient demonstration of Porphyry that
the Book of Daniel is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>Maccabean. The general dilemma put
by Collins&mdash;that either the prophecies must be reduced, textually
and otherwise, to non-prophetic utterances, or Christianity must give
up prophetic claims&mdash;has never since been solved.</p>
<p class="par">The deistic movement was now in full flood, the acute
<span class="sc">Mandeville</span><a class="noteref" id="xd21e11065src"

his <i>Free Thoughts on Religion</i>, and in 1723 a freshly-expanded
edition of his very anti-evangelical <i>Fable of the Bees</i>; while an
eccentric ex-clergyman, <span class="sc">Thomas Woolston</span>, who
had already lost his fellowship of Sidney-Sussex College, Cambridge,
for vagaries of doctrine and action, contributed in 1726&ndash;28 his
freshly reasoned but heedlessly ribald <i>Discourses on Miracles</i>.
Voltaire, who was in England in 1728, tells that thirty thousand copies
were sold;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11084src" href="#xd21e11084"
name="xd21e11084src">57</a> while sixty pamphlets were written in
opposition. Woolston&rsquo;s were indeed well fitted to arouse wrath
and rejoinder. The dialectic against the argument from miracles in
general, and the irrelevance or nullity of certain miracles in
particular, is really cogent, and anticipates at points the thought of
the nineteenth century. But Woolston was of the tribe who can argue no
issue without jesting, and who stamp levity on every cause by force of
innate whimsicality. Thus he could best sway the light-hearted when his
cause called for the winning-over of the earnest. Arguments that might
have been made convincing were made to pass as banter, and serious
spirits were repelled. It was during this debate that <span class=
"sc">Conyers Middleton</span>, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,
produced his <i>Letter from Rome</i> (1729), wherein the part of
paganism in Christianity is so set forth as to carry inference further
than the argument ostensibly goes. In that year the heads of Oxford
University publicly lamented the spread of open deism among the
students; and the proclamation did nothing to check the contagion. In
<i>Fogg&rsquo;s Weekly Journal</i> of July 4, 1730, it is announced
that &ldquo;one of the principal colleges in Oxford has of late been
infested with deists; and that three deistical students have been
expelled; and a fourth has had his degree deferred two years, during
which he is to be closely confined in college; and, among other things,
is to translate Leslie&rsquo;s <i>Short and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>Easy
Method with the Deists</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11132src"
href="#xd21e11132" name="xd21e11132src">58</a> It is not hard to divine
the effect of such exegetic methods. In 1731, the author of an
apologetic pamphlet in reply to Woolston laments that even at the
universities young men &ldquo;too often&rdquo; become tainted with
&ldquo;infidelity&rdquo;; and, on the other hand, directing his battery
against those who &ldquo;causelessly profess to build their skeptical
notions&rdquo; on the writings of Locke, he complains of Dr. Holdsworth
and other academic polemists who had sought to rob orthodoxy of the
credit of such a champion as Locke by &ldquo;consigning him over to
that class of freethinkers and skeptics to which he was an
adversary.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11139src" href=

<p class="par">With the most famous work of <span class="sc">Matthew
Tindal</span>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11149src" href="#xd21e11149"
name="xd21e11149src">60</a> <i>Christianity as Old as Creation</i>
(1730), the excitement seems to have reached high-water mark. Here was
vivacity without flippancy, and argument without irrelevant mirth; and
the work elicited from first to last over a hundred and fifty replies,
at home and abroad. Tindal&rsquo;s thesis is that the idea of a good
God involved that of a simple, perfect, and universal religion, which
must always have existed among mankind, and must have essentially
consisted in moral conduct. Christianity, insofar as it is true, must
therefore be a statement of this primordial religion; and moral reason
must be the test, not tradition or Scripture. One of the first replies
was the <i>Vindication of Scripture</i> by Waterland, to which
Middleton promptly offered a biting retort in a <i>Letter to Dr.
Waterland</i> (1731) that serves to show the slightness of its
author&rsquo;s faith. After demolishing Waterland&rsquo;s case as
calculated rather to arouse than to allay skepticism, he undertakes to
offer a better reply of his own. It is to the simple effect that some
religion is necessary to mankind in modern as in ancient times; that
Christianity meets the need very well; and that to set up reason in its
place is &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo; and &ldquo;the attempt therefore
foolish and irrational,&rdquo; in addition to being &ldquo;criminal and
immoral,&rdquo; when politically considered.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11171src" href="#xd21e11171" name="xd21e11171src">61</a> Such
legalist criticism, if seriously meant, was hardly likely to discredit
Tindal&rsquo;s book. Its directness and simplicity of appeal to what
passed for theistic common-sense were indeed fitted to give it the
widest audience yet won by any deist; and its anti-clericalism would
carry it far among his fellow Whigs to begin with.<a class="noteref"

and so escaped prosecution, dying in 1733, when the second part of his
book, left ready for publication, was deliberately destroyed by Bishop
Gibson, into whose hands it came. In 1736 he and Shaftesbury are
described by an orthodox apologist as the &ldquo;two oracles of

<p class="par">Woolston, who put his name to his books, after being
arrested in May, 1728, and released on bail, was prosecuted in 1729 on
the charge of blasphemy, in that he had derided the gospel miracles and
represented Jesus alternately as an impostor, a sorcerer, and a
magician. His friendly counsel ingeniously argued that Woolston had
aimed at safeguarding Christianity by returning to the allegorical
method of the early Fathers; and that he had shown his reverence for
Jesus and religion by many specific expressions; but the jury took a
simpler view, and, without leaving the court, found Woolston guilty. He
was sentenced to pay a fine of &pound;100, to suffer a year&rsquo;s
imprisonment, and either to find surety for his future good conduct or
pay or give sureties for &pound;2,000.<a class="noteref" id=

commonly said to have paid the penalty of imprisonment for the rest of
his life (d. 1733), being unable to pay the fine of &pound;100; but

than the statement that he died in prison; adding: &ldquo;Several of my

Unitarianism held by the Bible, calling only for a revision of the
central Christian dogma. It had indeed gained much theological ground
in the past quarter of a century. Nothing is more instructive in the
culture-history of the period than the rapidity with which the
Presbyterian succession of clergy passed from violent Calvinism, by way
of &ldquo;Baxterian&rdquo; Arminianism, to Arianism, and thence in many
cases to Unitarianism. First they virtually adopted the creed of the
detested Laud, whom their fathers had hated for it; then they passed
step by step to a heresy for which their fathers had slain men. A
closely similar process took place in Geneva, where Servetus after
death triumphed over his slayer.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11233src"

dissolved.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11244src" href="#xd21e11244"

gain in popularity as it fell away from fanaticism; but the decline of
Nonconformity in the first half of the eighteenth century was common to
all the sects, and did not specially affect the Presbyterians. Of the
many &ldquo;free&rdquo; churches established in England and Wales after
the Act of Toleration (1689), about half were extinct in 1715;<a class=

State-endowed parish priest had an enduring advantage over his rival.
But the Hewley endowment gave a certain economic basis to the
Presbyterians; and the concern for scholarship which had always marked
their body kept them more open to intellectual influences than the
ostensibly more free-minded and certainly more democratic sectaries of

<p class="par first">Anti-scriptural writers could not hope for such
toleration, being doubly odious to the Church. Berkeley, in 1721, had
complained bitterly<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11327src" href=
"#xd21e11327" name="xd21e11327src">80</a> of the general indifference
to religion, which his writings had done nothing to alter; and in 1736
he angrily demanded that blasphemy should be punished like high
treason.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11331src" href="#xd21e11331" name=
"xd21e11331src">81</a> His <i>Minute Philosopher</i> (1732) betrays
throughout his angry consciousness of the vogue of freethinking after
twenty years of resistance from his profession; and that performance is
singularly ill fitted to alter the opinions of unbelievers. In his
earlier papers attacking them he had put a stress of malice that, in a
mind of his calibre, is startling even to the student of religious
history.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11338src" href="#xd21e11338" name=
"xd21e11338src">82</a> It reveals him as no less possessed by the
passion of creed than the most ignorant priest of his Church. For him
all freethinkers were detested disturbers of his emotional life; and of
the best of them, as Collins, Shaftesbury, and Spinoza, he speaks with
positive fury. In the <i>Minute Philosopher</i>, half-conscious of the
wrongness of his temper, he sets himself to make the unbelievers figure
in dialogue as ignorant, pretentious, and coarse-natured; while his own
mouthpieces are meant to be benign, urbane, wise, and persuasive. Yet
in the very pages so planned he unwittingly reveals that the
freethinkers whom he goes about to caricature were commonly
good-natured in tone, while he becomes as virulent as ever in his
eagerness to discredit them. Not a paragraph in the book attains to the
spirit of judgment or fairness; all is special pleading, overstrained
and embittered sarcasm, rankling animus. Gifted alike for literature
and for philosophy, keen of vision in economic problems where the mass
of men were short-sighted, he was flawed on the side of his faith by
the hysteria to which it always <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163"
href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>stirred him. No man was less
qualified to write a well-balanced dialogue as between his own side and
its opponents. To candour he never attains, unless it be in the sense
that his passion recoils on his own case. Even while setting up
ninepins of ill-put &ldquo;infidel&rdquo; argument to knock down, he
elaborates futilities of rebuttal, indicating to every attentive reader
the slightness of his rational basis.</p>
<p class="par">On the strength of this performance he might fitly be
termed the most ill-conditioned sophist of his age, were it not for the
perception that religious feeling in him has become a pathological
phase, and that he suffers incomparably more from his own passions than
he can inflict on his enemies by his eager thrusts at them. More than
almost any gifted pietist of modern times he sets us wondering at the
power of creed in certain cases to overgrow judgment and turn to naught
the rarest faculties. No man in Berkeley&rsquo;s day had a finer
natural lucidity and suppleness of intelligence; yet perhaps no
polemist on his side did less either to make converts or to establish a
sound intellectual practice. Plain men on the freethinking side he must
either have bewildered by his metaphysic or revolted by his spite;
while to the more efficient minds he stood revealed as a kind of
inspired child, rapt in the construction and manipulation of a set of
brilliant sophisms which availed as much for any other creed as for his
own. To the armoury of Christian apologetic now growing up in England
he contributed a special form of the skeptical argument: freethinkers,
he declared, made certain arbitrary or irrational assumptions in
accepting Newton&rsquo;s doctrine of fluxions, and it was only their
prejudice that prevented them from being similarly accommodating to
Christian mysteries.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11351src" href=
"#xd21e11351" name="xd21e11351src">83</a> It is a kind of argument dear
to minds pre-convinced and incapable of a logical revision, but worse
than inept as against opponents; and it availed no more in
Berkeley&rsquo;s hands than it had done in those of Huet.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11356src" href="#xd21e11356" name=
"xd21e11356src">84</a> To theosophy, indeed, Berkeley rendered a more
successful service in presenting it with the no better formula of
&ldquo;existence [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>in</i> consciousness] dependent
<i>upon</i> consciousness&rdquo;&mdash;a verbalism which has served the
purposes of theology in the philosophic schools down till our own day.
For his, however, the popular polemic value of such a theorem must have
been sufficiently countervailed by his vehement championship of the
doctrine of passive obedience in its most extreme
form&mdash;&ldquo;that loyalty is a virtue or moral duty; and
disloyalty or rebellion, in the most strict and proper sense, a vice or
crime against the law of nature.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=

<p class="par">It belonged to the overstrung temperament of Berkeley
that, like a nervous artist, he should figure to himself all his
freethinking antagonists as personally odious, himself growing odious
under the obsession; and he solemnly asserts, in his <i>Discourse to
Magistrates</i>, that there had been &ldquo;lately set up within this
city of Dublin&rdquo; an &ldquo;execrable fraternity of
blasphemers,&rdquo; calling themselves &ldquo;blasters,&rdquo; and
forming &ldquo;a distinct society, whereof the proper and avowed
business shall be to shock all serious Christians by the most impious
and horrid blasphemies, uttered in the most public
manner.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11380src" href="#xd21e11380"
name="xd21e11380src">86</a> There appears to be not a grain of truth in
this astonishing assertion, to which no subsequent historian has paid
the slightest attention. In a period in which freethinking books had
been again and again burned in Dublin by the public hangman, such a
society could be projected only in a nightmare; and Berkeley&rsquo;s
hallucination may serve as a sign of the extent to which his judgment
had been deranged by his passions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11385src"
href="#xd21e11385" name="xd21e11385src">87</a> His forensic temper is
really on a level with that of the most incompetent swashbucklers on
his side.</p>
<p class="par">When educated Christians could be so habitually
envenomed as was Berkeley, there was doubtless a measure of contrary
heat among English unbelievers; but, apart altogether from what could
be described as blasphemy, unbelief abounded in the most cultured
society of the day. Bolingbroke&rsquo;s rationalism had been privately
well known; and so distinguished a personage as the brilliant and
scholarly Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, hated by Pope, is one of the
reputed freethinkers of her time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11390src"
href="#xd21e11390" name="xd21e11390src">88</a> In the very year of the
publication of Berkeley&rsquo;s <i>Minute Philosopher</i>, the first
two epistles of the <i>Essay on Man</i> of his own friend and admirer,
Pope, gave a new currency to the form of optimistic deism created by
Shaftesbury, and later elaborated by Bolingbroke. Pope was always
anxiously hostile in his allusions to the professed
freethinkers<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11402src" href="#xd21e11402"
name="xd21e11402src">89</a>&mdash;among whom Bolingbroke only
posthumously enrolled himself&mdash;and in private he specially
aspersed Shaftesbury, from whom he had taken so much;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e11410src" href="#xd21e11410" name="xd21e11410src">90</a> but
his prudential tactic gave all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165"
href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>the more currency to the
virtual deism he enunciated. Given out without any critical allusion to
Christianity, and put forward as a vindication of the ways of God to
men, it gave to heresy, albeit in a philosophically incoherent
exposition, the status of a well-bred piety. A good authority
pronounces that &ldquo;the <i>Essay on Man</i> did more to spread
English deism in France than all the works of
Shaftesbury&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11438src" href=
"#xd21e11438" name="xd21e11438src">91</a> and we have explicit
testimony that the poet privately avowed the deistic view of
things.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11444src" href="#xd21e11444" name=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The soul, uneasy and confined <i>from</i> home,</p>

<p class="par first">originally ran &ldquo;<i>at</i> home&rdquo;; but,
says Warton, &ldquo;this expression seeming to exclude a future
existence, <i>as, to speak the plain truth, it was intended to do</i>,
it was altered&rdquo;&mdash;presumably by Warburton. (Warton&rsquo;s
<i>Essay on Pope</i>, 4th ed. ii, 67.) The Spinozistic or pantheistic
character of much of the <i>Essay on Man</i> was noted by various
critics, in particular by the French Academician De Crousaz (<i lang=
"fr">Examen de l&rsquo;Essay de M. Pope sur l&rsquo;Homme</i>, 1748, p.
90, etc.) After promising to justify the ways of God to man, writes
Crousaz (p. 33), Pope turns round and justifies man, leaving God
charged with all men&rsquo;s sins. When the younger Racine, writing to
the Chevalier Ramsay in 1742, charged the <i>Essay</i> with irreligion,
Pope wrote him repudiating alike Spinoza and Leibnitz. (Warton, ii,
121.) In 1755, however, the Abb&eacute; Gauchat renewed the attack,
declaring that the <i>Essay</i> was &ldquo;neither Christian nor
philosophic&rdquo; (<i lang="fr">Lettres Critiques</i>, i, 346).
Warburton at first charged the poem with rank atheism, and afterwards
vindicated it in his manner. (Warton, i, 125.) But in Germany, in the
youth of Goethe, we find the <i>Essay</i> regarded by Christians as an
unequivocally deistic poem. (Goethe&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Wahrheit und
Dichtung</i>, Th. II, B. vii: <i lang="de">Werke</i>, ed. 1866, xi,
263.) And by a modern Christian polemist the <i>Essay</i> is described
as &ldquo;the best positive result of English deism in the eighteenth
century&rdquo; (Gostwick, <i>German Culture and Christianity</i>, 1882,
p. 31).</p>

<p class="par">In point of fact, deism was the fashionable way of
thinking among cultured people. Though Voltaire testifies from personal
knowledge that there were in England in his day many principled
atheists,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11518src" href="#xd21e11518" name=

real production of theistic belief by the concurrence of the deistic
propaganda on this head with that of the clergy, themselves in so many
cases deists.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11534src" href="#xd21e11534"
name="xd21e11534src">95</a> Bishop Burnet, in the Conclusion to the
<i>History of his Own Time</i>, pronounces that &ldquo;there are few
atheists, but many infidels, who are indeed very little better than the
atheists.&rdquo; Collins observed that nobody had doubted the existence
of God until the Boyle lecturers began to prove it; and Clarke had more
than justified the jest by arguing, in his Boyle Lectures for 1705,
that all deism logically leads to atheism. But though the apologists
roused much discussion on the theistic issue, the stress of the
apologetic literature passed from the theme of atheism to that of
deism. Shaftesbury&rsquo;s early <i>Inquiry Concerning Virtue</i> had
assumed the existence of a good deal of atheism; but his later
writings, and those of his school, do not indicate much atheistic
opposition.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11559src" href="#xd21e11559"

maintain, &ldquo;against impostures of philosophy,&rdquo; that
&ldquo;matter and motion must be the foundation of thought in men and

matter is capable of thought; and <span class="sc">Samuel Strutt</span>
(&ldquo;of the Temple&rdquo;), whose <i>Philosophical Inquiry into the
Physical Spring of Human Actions, and the Immediate Cause of
Thinking</i> (1732), is a most tersely cogent sequence of materialistic
argument, never raises any question of deity. The result was that the
problem of &ldquo;materialism&rdquo; was virtually dropped,
Strutt&rsquo;s essay in particular passing into general oblivion.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">It was replied to, however, with the
<i>Inquiry</i> of Collins, as late as 1760, by a Christian
controversialist who admits Strutt <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167"
href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>to have been &ldquo;a
gentleman of an excellent genius for philosophical inquiries, and a
close reasoner from those principles he laid down&rdquo; (<i>An Essay
towards demonstrating the Immateriality and Free Agency of the
Soul</i>, 1760, p. 94). The Rev. Mr. Monk, in his <i>Life of
Bentley</i> (2nd ed. 1833, ii, 391), absurdly speaks of Strutt as
having &ldquo;dressed up the arguments of Lord Herbert of Cherbury and
other enemies of religion in a new shape.&rdquo; The reverend gentleman
cannot have paid any attention to the arguments either of Herbert or of
Strutt, which have no more in common than those of Toland and Hume.
Strutt&rsquo;s book was much too closely reasoned to be popular. His
name was for the time, however, associated with a famous scandal at
Cambridge University. When in 1739 proceedings were taken against what
was described as an &ldquo;atheistical society&rdquo; there, Strutt was
spoken of as its &ldquo;oracle.&rdquo; One of the members was Paul
Whitehead, satirized by Pope. Another, Tinkler Ducket, a Fellow of
Caius College, in holy orders, was prosecuted in the
Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Court on the twofold charge of proselytizing
for atheism and of attempting to seduce a &ldquo;female.&rdquo; In his
defence he explained that he had been for some time &ldquo;once more a
believer in God and Christianity&rdquo;; but was nevertheless expelled.

<p class="par first">No less marked is the failure to develop the
&ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo; from the notable start made in 1739 in
the very remarkable <i>Inquiry into the Jewish and Christian
Revelations</i> by Samuel Parvish, who made the vital discovery that
Deuteronomy is a product of the seventh century <span class=

form of a dialogue between a Christian and a Japanese, went into a

that time the more open-minded men had come to a point of view from
which it did not greatly matter when Deuteronomy was written, or
precisely how a cultus was built up; while orthodoxy could not dream of
abandoning its view of inspiration. There was thus an arrest alike of
historical criticism and of the higher philosophic thought under the
stress of the concrete disputes over ethics, miracles, prophecy, and
politics; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>a habit of taking deity for granted became
normal, with the result that when the weak point was pressed upon by
Law and Butler there was a sense of blankness on both sides. But among
men theistically inclined, the argument of Tindal against revelationism
was extremely telling, and it had more literary impressiveness than any
writing on the orthodox side before Butler. By this time the
philosophic influence of Spinoza&mdash;seen as early as 1699 in
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <i>Inquiry Concerning Virtue</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e11649src" href="#xd21e11649" name="xd21e11649src">103</a> and
avowed by Clarke when he addressed his <i>Demonstration</i> (1705)
&ldquo;more particularly in answer to Mr. Hobbs, Spinoza, and their
followers&rdquo;&mdash;had spread among the studious class, greatly
reinforcing the deistic movement; so that in 1732 Berkeley, who ranked
him among &ldquo;weak and wicked writers,&rdquo; described him as
&ldquo;the great leader of our modern infidels.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">See the <i>Minute Philosopher</i>, Dial. vii,
&sect; 29. Similarly Leland, in the <i>Supplement</i> (1756) to his
<i>View of the Deistical Writers</i> (afterwards incorporated as Letter
VI), speaks of Spinoza as &ldquo;the most applauded doctor of modern
atheism.&rdquo; Sir Leslie Stephen&rsquo;s opinion (<i>English
Thought</i>, i, 33), that &ldquo;few of the deists, probably,&rdquo;
read Spinoza, seems to be thus outweighed. If they did not in great
numbers read the <i>Ethica</i>, they certainly read the
<i>Tractatus</i> and the letters. As early as 1677 we find
Stillingfleet, in the preface to his <i>Letter to a Deist</i>, speaking
of Spinoza as &ldquo;a late author [who] I hear is mightily in vogue
among many who cry up anything on the atheistical side, though never so
weak and trifling&rdquo;; and further of a mooted proposal to translate
the <i>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</i> into English. A translation
was published in 1689. In 1685 the Scotch Professor George Sinclar, in
the &ldquo;Preface to the Reader&rdquo; of his <i>Satan&rsquo;s
Invisible World Discovered</i>, writes that &ldquo;There are a
monstrous <span class="corr" id="xd21e11692" title=

recantation, <i>The Deist&rsquo;s Manual</i> (1705, p. 192), the
indifferent Pleonexus, who &ldquo;took more delight in bags than in
books,&rdquo; and demurs to accumulating the latter, avows that he has
a few, among them being Hobbes and Spinoza. Evelyn, writing about
1680&ndash;90, speaks of &ldquo;that infamous book, the <i>Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus</i>,&rdquo; as &ldquo;a wretched obstacle to the
searchers of holy truth&rdquo; (<i>The History of Religion</i>, 1850,
p. xxvii). Cp. Halyburton, <i>Natural Religion Insufficient</i>,

<p class="par first">Among the deists of the upper classes was the
young William Pitt, afterwards Lord Chatham, if, as has been alleged,
it was he who in 1733, two years before he entered Parliament,
contributed to the <i>London Journal</i> a &ldquo;Letter on
Superstition,&rdquo; the work of a pronounced freethinker.<a class=

with which Chubb, in a multitude of tracts, followed up his early
Unitarian essay of 1715, brought an ethical &ldquo;Christian
rationalism&rdquo; within the range of the unscholarly many.
<span class="sc">Thomas Morgan</span> (d. 1741), a physician, began in
the <i>Moral Philosopher</i>, 1739&ndash;1740,<a class="noteref" id=

sketch a rationalistic theory of Christian origins, besides putting the
critical case with new completeness. Morgan had been at one time a
dissenting minister at Frome, Somerset, and had been dismissed because
of his deistical opinions. Towards the Jehovah and the ethic of the Old
Testament he holds, however, the attitude rather of an ancient Gnostic
than of a modern rationalist; and in his philosophy he is either a very
&ldquo;godly&rdquo; deist or a pantheist miscarried.<a class="noteref"

<p class="par">At the same time <span class="sc">Peter Annet</span>
(1693&ndash;1769), a schoolmaster and inventor of a system of
shorthand, widened the propaganda in other directions. He seems to have
been the first freethought lecturer, for his first pamphlet, <i>Judging
for Ourselves: or, Freethinking the Great Duty of Religion</i>,
&ldquo;By P. A., Minister of the Gospel&rdquo; (1739), consists of
&ldquo;Two Lectures delivered at Plaisterers&rsquo; Hall.&rdquo;
Through all his propaganda, of which the more notable portions are his
<i>Supernaturals Examined</i> and a series of controversies on the
Resurrection, there runs a train of shrewd critical sense, put forth in
crisp and vivacious English, which made him a popular force. What he
lacked was the due gravity and dignity for the handling of such a theme
as the reversal of a nation&rsquo;s faith. Like Woolston, he is
facetious where he should be serious; entertaining where he had need be
impressive; provocative where he should have aimed at persuasion. We
cannot say what types he influenced, or how deep his influence went: it
appears only that he swayed many whose suffrages weighed little. At
length, when in 1761 he issued nine numbers of <i>The Free
Inquirer</i>, in which he attacked the Pentateuch with much insight and
cogency, but with a certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href=
"#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>want of rational balance (shown
also in his treatise, <i>Social Bliss Considered</i>, 1749), he was
made a victim of the then strengthened spirit of persecution, being
sentenced to stand thrice in the pillory with the label &ldquo;For
Blasphemy,&rdquo; and to suffer a year&rsquo;s hard labour.
Nevertheless, he was popular enough to start a school on his
release.</p>
<p class="par">Such popularity, of course, was alien to the literary
and social traditions of the century; and from the literary point of
view the main line of deistic propaganda, as apart from the essays and
treatises of Hume and the posthumous works of Bolingbroke, ends with
the younger <span class="sc">Henry Dodwell&rsquo;s</span> (anonymous)
ironical essay, <i>Christianity not Founded on Argument</i> (1741). So
rigorously congruous is the reasoning of that brilliant treatise that
some have not quite unjustifiably taken it for the work of a dogmatic
believer, standing at some such position as that taken up before him by

<p class="par first">Of the work done by English deism thus far, it may
suffice to say that within two generations it had more profoundly
altered the intellectual temper of educated men than any religious
movement had ever done in the same time. This appears above all from
the literature produced by orthodoxy in reply, where the mere defensive
resort to reasoning, apart from the accounts of current rationalism,
outgoes anything in the previous history of literature. The whole
evolution is a remarkable instance of the effect on intellectual
progress of the diversion of a nation&rsquo;s general energy from war
and intense political faction to mental activities. A similar diversion
had taken place at the Restoration, to be followed by a return to civil
and foreign strife, which arrested it. It was in the closing years of
Anne, and in the steady <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of Walpole under the first
two Georges, that the ferment worked at its height. Collins&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span><i>Discourse of Freethinking</i> was synchronous
with the Peace of Utrecht: the era of war re-opened in 1739, much
against the will of Walpole, who resigned in 1742. Home and foreign
wars thereafter became common; and in 1751 Clive opened the period of
imperialistic expansion, determining national developments on that main
line, concurrently with that of the new industry. Could the discussion
have been continuous&mdash;could England have remained what she was in
the main deistic period, a workshop of investigation and a battleground
of ideas&mdash;all European development might have been indefinitely
hastened. But the deists, for the most part educated men appealing to
educated men or to the shrewdest readers among the artisans, had not
learned to reckon with the greater social forces; and beyond a certain
point they could not affect England&rsquo;s intellectual destinies.</p>
<p class="par">It is worse than idle to argue that &ldquo;the true
cause of the decay of deism is to be sought in its internal
weakness,&rdquo; in the sense that &ldquo;it was not rooted in the
deepest convictions, nor associated with the most powerful emotions of
its adherents.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11804src" href=
"#xd21e11804" name="xd21e11804src">110</a> No such charge can be even
partially proved. The deists were at least as much in earnest as
two-thirds of the clergy: the determining difference, in this regard,
was the economic basis of the latter, and their social hold of an
ignorant population. The clergy, who could not argue the deists down in
the court of culture, had in their own jurisdiction the great mass of
the uneducated lower classes, and the great mass of the women of all
classes, whom the ideals of the age kept uneducated, with a difference.
And while the more cultured clergy were themselves in large measure
deists, the majority, in the country parishes, remained uncritical and
unreflective, caring little even to cultivate belief among their
flocks. The &ldquo;contempt of the clergy&rdquo; which had subsisted
from the middle of the seventeenth century (if, indeed, it should not
be dated from the middle of the sixteenth) meant among other things
that popular culture remained on a lower plane. With the multitude
remaining a ready hotbed for new &ldquo;enthusiasm,&rdquo; and the
women of the middle and upper orders no less ready nurturers of new
generations of young believers, the work of emancipation was but begun
when deism was made &ldquo;fashionable.&rdquo; And with England on the
way to a new era at once of industrial and imperial expansion, in which
the energies that for a generation had made her a leader of European
thought were diverted to arms and to commerce, the critical and
rationalizing work of the deistical generation could not go on as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>it had begun. That generation left its specific
mark on the statute-book in a complete repeal of the old laws relating
to witchcraft;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11812src" href="#xd21e11812"
name="xd21e11812src">111</a> on literature in a whole library of
propaganda and apology; on moral and historic science in a new movement
of humanism, which was to find its check in the French Revolution.</p>
<p class="par">How it affected the general intelligence for good may be
partly gathered from a comparison of the common English political
attitudes towards Ireland in the first and the last quarters of the
century. Under William was wrought the arrest of Irish industry and
commerce, begun after the Restoration; under Anne were enacted the
penal laws against Catholics&mdash;as signal an example of religious
iniquity as can well be found in all history. By the middle of the
century these laws had become anachronisms for all save bigots.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The wave of freethought that was spreading
over Europe and permeating its literature had not failed to affect
Ireland.... An atmosphere of skepticism was fatal to the Penal Code.
What element of religious persecution there had been in it had long
ceased to be operative&rdquo; (R. Dunlop, in <i>Camb. Mod. Hist.</i>
vi, 489). Macaulay&rsquo;s testimony on this head is noteworthy:
&ldquo;The philosophy of the eighteenth century had purified English
Whiggism of the deep taint of intolerance which had been contracted
during a long and close alliance with the Puritanism of the eighteenth
century&rdquo; (<i>History</i>, ch. xvii, <i>end</i>).</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The denunciations of the penal laws by Arthur Young in
1780<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11832src" href="#xd21e11832" name=
"xd21e11832src">112</a> are the outcome of two generations of deistic
thinking; the spirit of religion has been ousted by judgment.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11837src" href="#xd21e11837" name=
"xd21e11837src">113</a> Could that spirit have had freer play, less
hindrance from blind passion, later history would have been a happier
record. But for reasons lying in the environment as well as in its own
standpoint, deism was not destined to rise on continuous
stepping-stones to social dominion.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Currency has been given to a misconception of
intellectual history by the authoritative statement that in the deistic
controversy &ldquo;all that was intellectually venerable in
England&rdquo; appeared &ldquo;on the side of Christianity&rdquo; (Sir
Leslie Stephen, <i>English Thought in the Eighteenth Century</i>, i,
86). The same thing, in effect, is said by Lecky: &ldquo;It was to
repel these [deistic] attacks [&lsquo;upon the miracles&rsquo;] that
the evidential school arose, and the annals of religious controversy
narrate few more complete victories than they achieved&rdquo; (<i>Rise
and Influence of Rationalism</i>, pop. ed. i, 175). The proposition
seems to be an echo of orthodox <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173"
href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>historiography, as Buckle had
before written in his note-book: &ldquo;In England skepticism made no
head. Such men as Toland and Tindal, Collins, Shaftesbury, Woolston,
were no match for Clarke, Warburton, and Lardner. They could make no
head till the time of Middleton&rdquo; (<i>Misc. Works</i>, abridged
ed. i, 321)&mdash;a strain of assertion which clearly proceeds on no
close study of the period. In the first place, all the writing on the
freethinking side was done under peril of Blasphemy Laws, and under
menace of all the calumny and ostracism that in Christian society
follow on advanced heresy; while the orthodox side could draw on the
entire clerical profession, over ten thousand strong, and trained for
and pledged to defence of the faith. Yet, when all is said, the
ordinary list of deists amply suffices to disprove Sir L.
Stephen&rsquo;s phrase. His &ldquo;intellectually venerable&rdquo; list
runs: Bentley, Locke, Berkeley, Clarke, Butler, Waterland, Warburton,
Sherlock, Gibson, Conybeare, Smalbroke, Leslie, Law, Leland, Lardner,
Foster, Doddridge, Lyttelton, Barrington, Addison, Pope, Swift. He
might have added Newton and Boyle. Sykes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11857src" href="#xd21e11857" name="xd21e11857src">114</a> Balguy,
Stebbing, and a &ldquo;host of others,&rdquo; he declares to be
&ldquo;now for the most part as much forgotten as their victims&rdquo;;
Young and Blackmore he admits to be in similar case. It is expressly
told of Doddridge, he might have added, that whereas that well-meaning
apologist put before his students at Northampton the ablest writings
both for and against Christianity, leaving them to draw their own
conclusions, many of his pupils, &ldquo;on leaving his institution,
became confirmed Arians and Socinians&rdquo; (Nichols in App. P to Life
of Arminius&mdash;<i>Works of Arminius</i>, 1825, i, 223&ndash;25).
This hardly spells success.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11864src" href=
"#xd21e11864" name="xd21e11864src">115</a> All told, the list includes
only three or four men of any permanent interest as thinkers, apart
from Newton; and only three or four more important as writers. The
description of Waterland,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11870src" href=
"#xd21e11870" name="xd21e11870src">116</a> Warburton,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e11873src" href="#xd21e11873" name="xd21e11873src">117</a>
Smalbroke,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11882src" href="#xd21e11882"
name="xd21e11882src">118</a> Sherlock, Leslie, and half-a-dozen more as
&ldquo;intellectually venerable&rdquo; is grotesque; even Bentley is a
strange subject for veneration.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, the list of &ldquo;the despised
deists,&rdquo; who &ldquo;make but a poor show when compared with this
imposing list,&rdquo; runs thus: Herbert, Hobbes, Blount, Halley (well
known to be an unbeliever, though he did not write on the subject),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>Toland, Shaftesbury, Collins, Mandeville,
Tindal, Chubb, Morgan, Dodwell, Middleton, Hume, Bolingbroke, Gibbon.
It would be interesting to know on what principles this group is
excluded from the intellectual veneration so liberally allotted to the
other. It is nothing to the purpose that Shaftesbury and Mandeville
wrote &ldquo;covertly&rdquo; and &ldquo;indirectly.&rdquo; The law and
the conditions compelled them to do so. It is still more beside the
case to say that &ldquo;Hume can scarcely be reckoned among the deists.
He is already [when?] emerging into a higher atmosphere.&rdquo; Hume
wrote explicitly as a deist; and only in his posthumous Dialogues did
he pass on to the atheistic position. At no time, moreover, was he
&ldquo;on the side of Christianity.&rdquo; On the other hand, Locke and
Clarke and Pope were clearly &ldquo;emerging into a higher
atmosphere&rdquo; than Christianity, since Locke is commonly reckoned
by the culture-historians, and even by Sir Leslie Stephen, as making
for deism; Pope was the pupil of Bolingbroke, and wrote as such; and
Clarke was shunned as an Arian. Newton, again, was a Unitarian, and
Leibnitz accused his system of making for irreligion. It would be hard
to show, further, who are the &ldquo;forgotten victims&rdquo; of Balguy
and the rest. Balguy criticized Shaftesbury, whose name is still a good
deal better known than Balguy&rsquo;s. The main line of deists is
pretty well remembered. And if we pair off Hume against Berkeley,
Hobbes against Locke, Middleton (as historical critic) against Bentley,
Shaftesbury against Addison, Mandeville against Swift, Bolingbroke
against Butler, Collins against Clarke, Herbert against Lyttelton,
Tindal against Waterland, and Gibbon against&mdash;shall we
say?&mdash;Warburton, it hardly appears that the overplus of merit goes
as Sir Leslie Stephen alleges, even if we leave Newton, with brain
unhinged, standing against Halley. The statement that the deists
&ldquo;are but a ragged regiment,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;in speculative
ability most of them were children by the side of their ablest
antagonists,&rdquo; is simply unintelligible unless the names of all
the ablest deists are left out. Locke, be it remembered, did not live
to meet the main deistic attack on Christianity; and Sir Leslie admits
the weakness of his pro-Christian performance.</p>
<p class="par">The bases of Sir Leslie Stephen&rsquo;s verdict may be
tested by his remarks that &ldquo;Collins, a <i>respectable country
gentleman</i>, showed considerable acuteness; Toland, <i>a poor denizen
of Grub Street</i>, and Tindal, a Fellow of All Souls, made a
<i>certain</i> display of learning, and succeeded in planting some
effective arguments.&rdquo; Elsewhere (pp. 217&ndash;227) Sir Leslie
admits that Collins had the best of the argument against his
&ldquo;venerable&rdquo; opponents on Prophecy; and Huxley credits him
with equal success in the argument with Clarke. The work of Collins on
<i>Human Liberty</i>, praised by a long series of students and experts,
and entirely above the capacity of Bentley, is philosophically as
durable as any portion of Locke, who made Collins his chosen friend and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>trustee, and who did not live to meet his
anti-Biblical arguments. Tindal, who had also won Locke&rsquo;s high
praise by his political essays, profoundly influenced such a student as
Laukhard (Lechler, p. 451). And Toland, whom even Mr. A. S. Farrar
(Bampton Lectures, p. 179) admitted to possess &ldquo;much originality
and learning,&rdquo; has struck Lange as a notable thinker, though he
<i>was</i> a poor man. Leibnitz, who answered him, praises his
acuteness, as does Pusey, who further admits the uncommon ability of
Morgan and Collins (<i>Histor. Enq. into German Rationalism</i>, 1828,
p. 126). It is time that the conventional English standards in these
matters should be abandoned by modern rationalists.</p>
<p class="par">The unfortunate effect of Sir Leslie Stephen&rsquo;s
dictum is seen in the assertion of Prof. H&ouml;ffding (<i>Hist. of
Modern Philos.</i> Eng. tr. 1900, i, 403), that Sir Leslie
&ldquo;rightly remarks of the English deists that they were altogether
inferior to their adversaries&rdquo;; and further (p. 405), that by the
later deists, &ldquo;Collins, Tindal, Morgan, etc., the dispute as to
miracles was carried on with great violence.&rdquo; It is here evident
that Prof. H&ouml;ffding has not read the writers he depreciates, for
those he names were far from being violent. Had he known the
literature, he would have named Woolston, not Collins and Tindal and
Morgan. He is merely echoing, without inquiring for himself, a judgment
which he regards as authoritative. In the same passage he declares that
&ldquo;only one of all the men formerly known as the &lsquo;English
deists&rsquo; [Toland] has rendered contributions of any value to the
history of thought.&rdquo; If this is said with a knowledge of the
works of Collins, Shaftesbury, and Mandeville, it argues a sad lack of
critical judgment. But there is reason to infer here also that Prof.
H&ouml;ffding writes in ignorance of the literature he discusses.</p>
<p class="par">While some professed rationalists thus belittle a series
of pioneers who did so much to make later rationalism possible, some
eminent theologians do them justice. Thus does Prof. Cheyne begin his
series of lectures on <i>Founders of Old Testament Criticism</i>
(1893): &ldquo;A well-known and honoured representative of progressive
German orthodoxy (J. A. Dorner) has set a fine example of historical
candour by admitting the obligations of his country to a much-disliked
form of English heterodoxy. He says that English deism, which found so
many apt disciples in Germany, &lsquo;by clearing away dead matter,
prepared the way for a reconstruction of theology from the very depths
of the heart&rsquo;s beliefs, and also subjected man&rsquo;s nature to
stricter observation.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11922src" href=
"#xd21e11922" name="xd21e11922src">119</a> This, however, as it appears
to me, is a very inadequate description of the facts. It was not merely
a new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>constructive stage of German theoretic theology,
and a keener psychological investigation, for which deism helped to
prepare the way, but also a great movement, which has in our own day
become in a strict sense international, concerned with the literary and
historical criticism of the Scriptures. Beyond all doubt, the Biblical
discussions which abound in the works of the deists and their opponents
contributed in no slight degree to the development of that
semi-apologetic criticism of the Old Testament of which J. D.
Michaelis, and in some degree even Eichhorn, were leading
representatives.... It is indeed singular that deism should have passed
away in England without having produced a great critical movement among
ourselves.&rdquo; Not quite so singular, perhaps, when we note that in
our own day Sir Leslie Stephen and Lecky and Prof. H&ouml;ffding could
sum up the work of the deists without a glance at what it meant for
Biblical criticism.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">If we were to set up a theory of intellectual
possibilities from what has actually taken place in the history of
thought, and without regard to the economic and political conditions
above mentioned, we might reason that deism failed permanently to
overthrow the current creed because it was not properly preceded by
discipline in natural science. There might well be stagnation in the
higher criticism of the Hebrew Scriptures when all natural science was
still coloured by them. In nothing, perhaps, is the danger of Sacred
Books more fully exemplified than in their influence for the
suppression of true scientific thought. A hundredfold more potently
than the faiths of ancient Greece has that of Christendom blocked the
way to all intellectually vital discovery. If even the fame and the
pietism of Newton could not save him from the charge of promoting
atheism, much less could obscure men hope to set up any view of natural
things which clashed with pulpit prejudice. But the harm lay deeper,
inasmuch as the ground was preoccupied by pseudo-scientific theories
which were at best fanciful modifications of the myths of Genesis.
Types of these performances are the treatise of Sir Matthew Hale on
<i>The Primitive Origination of Mankind</i> (1685); Dr. Thomas
Burnet&rsquo;s <i>Sacred Theory of the Earth</i> (1680&ndash;1689); and
Whiston&rsquo;s <i>New Theory of the Earth</i> (1696)&mdash;all devoid
of scientific value; Hale&rsquo;s work being pre-Newtonian;
Burnet&rsquo;s anti-Newtonian, though partly critical as regards the
sources of the Pentateuch; and Whiston&rsquo;s a combination of Newton
and myth with his own quaint speculations. Even the <i>Natural History
of the Earth</i> of Prof. John Woodward (1695), after <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>recognizing that fossils were really prehistoric
remains, decided that they were deposited by the Deluge.<a class=

<p class="par">Woodward&rsquo;s book is in its own way instructive as
regards the history of opinion. A &ldquo;Professor of Physick&rdquo; in
Gresham College, F.C.P., and F.R.S., he goes about his work in a
methodical and ostensibly scientific fashion, colligates the phenomena,
examines temperately the hypotheses of the many previous inquirers, and
shows no violence of orthodox prepossession. He claims to have
considered Moses &ldquo;only as an historian,&rdquo; and to give him
credit finally because he finds his narrative &ldquo;punctually
true.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11974src" href="#xd21e11974"
name="xd21e11974src">121</a> He had before him an abundance of facts
irreconcilable with the explanation offered by the Flood story; yet he
actually adds to that myth a thesis of universal decomposition and
dissolution of the earth&rsquo;s strata by the flood&rsquo;s
action<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11977src" href="#xd21e11977" name=
"xd21e11977src">122</a>&mdash;a hypothesis far more extravagant than
any of those he dismissed. With all his method and scrutiny he had
remained possessed by the tradition, and could not cast it off. It
would seem as if such a book, reducing the tradition to an absurdity,
was bound at least to put its more thoughtful readers on the right
track. But the legend remained in possession of the general
intelligence as of Woodward&rsquo;s; and beyond his standpoint science
made little advance for many years. Moral and historical criticism,
then, as regards some main issues, had gone further than scientific;
and men&rsquo;s thinking on certain problems of cosmic philosophy was
thus arrested for lack of due basis or discipline in experiential
science.</p>
<p class="par">The final account of the arrest of exact Biblical
criticism in the eighteenth century, however, is that which explains
also the arrest of the sciences. English energy, broadly speaking, was
diverted into other channels. In the age of Chatham it became more and
more military and industrial, imperialist and commercial; and the
scientific work of Newton was considerably less developed by English
hands than was the critical work of the first deists. Long before the
French Revolution, mathematical and astronomical science were being
advanced by French minds, the English doing nothing. Lagrange and
Euler, Clairaut and D&rsquo;Alembert, carried on the task, till Laplace
consummated it in his great theory, which is to Newton&rsquo;s what
Newton&rsquo;s was to that of Copernicus. It was Frenchmen,
freethinkers to a man, who built up the new astronomy, while England
was producing only eulogies of Newton&rsquo;s greatness. &ldquo;No
British name is ever mentioned in the list of mathematicians
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=

completed the magnificent edifice of which he laid the

id="xd21e11993src" href="#xd21e11993" name="xd21e11993src">124</a>
Throughout the latter half of the eighteenth century &ldquo;there was
hardly an individual in this country who possessed an intimate
acquaintance with the methods of investigation which had conducted the
foreign mathematicians to so many sublime results.&rdquo;<a class=

name="xd21e12002src">126</a> and Newton&rsquo;s name was all the while
vaunted, unwarrantably enough, as being on the side of Christian
orthodoxy. Halley&rsquo;s great hypothesis of the motion of the solar
system in space, put forward in 1718, borne out by Cassini and Le
Monnier, was left to be established by Mayer of
G&ouml;ttingen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12009src" href="#xd21e12009"
name="xd21e12009src">127</a> There was nothing specially incidental to
deism, then, in the non-development of the higher criticism in England
after Collins and Parvish, or in the lull of critical speculation in
the latter half of the century. It was part of a general social
readjustment in which English attention was turned from the mental life
to the physical, from intension of thought to extension of empire.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Playfair (as cited, p. 39; Brewster, <i>Memoirs of
Newton</i>, i, 348, <i>note</i>) puts forward the theory that the
progress of the higher science in France was due to the &ldquo;small
pensions and great honours&rdquo; bestowed on scientific men by the
Academy of Sciences. The lack of such an institution in England he
traces to &ldquo;mercantile prejudices,&rdquo; without explaining these
in their turn. They are to be understood as the consequences of the
special expansion of commercial and industrial life in England in the
eighteenth century, when France, on the contrary, losing India and
North America, had her energies in a proportional degree thrown back on
the life of the mind. French freethought, it will be observed, expanded
<i>with</i> science, while in England there occurred, not a spontaneous
reversion to orthodoxy any more than a surrender of the doctrine of
Newton, but a general turning of attention in other directions. It is
significant that the most important names in the literature of deism
after 1740 are those of Hume and Smith, late products of the
intellectual atmosphere of pre-industrial Scotland; of Bolingbroke, an
aristocrat of the deistic generation, long an exile in France, who left
his works to be published after his death; and of Gibbon, who also
breathed the intellectual air of France.</p>

accompanying social conditions. Butler&rsquo;s book had very little
influence till long after his death,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12044src" href="#xd21e12044" name="xd21e12044src">129</a> being
indeed very ill-fitted to turn contemporary deists to Christianity. It
does but develop one form of the skeptical argument for faith, as
Berkeley had developed another; and that form of reasoning never does
attain to anything better than a success of despair. The main argument
being that natural religion is open to the same objections as revealed,
on the score (1) of the inconsistency of Nature with divine
benevolence, and (2) that we must be guided in opinion as in conduct by
probability, a Mohammedan could as well use the theorem for the Koran
as could a Christian for the Bible; and the argument against the
justice of Nature tended logically to atheism. But the deists had left
to them the resource of our modern theists&mdash;that of surmising a
beneficence above human comprehension; and it is clear that if Butler
made any converts they must have been of a very unenthusiastic kind. It
is therefore safe to say with Pattison that &ldquo;To whatever causes
is to be attributed the decline of deism from 1750 onwards, the books
polemically written against it cannot be reckoned among
them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12050src" href="#xd21e12050"
name="xd21e12050src">130</a></p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, even deists who were affected by the
plea that the Bible need not be more consistent and satisfactory than
Nature, could find refuge in Unitarianism, a creed which, as
industriously propounded by Priestley<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12058src" href="#xd21e12058" name="xd21e12058src">131</a> towards
the end of the century, made a numerical progress out of all proportion
to that of orthodoxy. The argument of William Law,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12061src" href="#xd21e12061" name="xd21e12061src">132</a>
again, which insisted on the irreconcilability of the course of things
with human reason, and called for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180"
href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>an abject submission to
revelation, could appeal only to minds already thus prostrate. Both his
and Butler&rsquo;s methods, in fact, prepared the way for <span class=
"sc">Hume</span>. And in the year 1741, five years after the issue of
the <i>Analogy</i> and seven before the issue of Hume&rsquo;s <i>Essay
on Miracles</i>, we find the thesis of that essay tersely affirmed in a
note to Book II of an anonymous translation (ascribed to <span class=
"sc">T. Francklin</span>) of Cicero&rsquo;s <i>De Natura
Deorum</i>.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The passage is worth comparing with Hume:
&ldquo;Hence we see what little credit ought to be paid to facts said
to be done out of the ordinary course of nature. These miracles
[cutting the whetstone, etc., related by Cicero, <i>De Div.</i> i, c.
xvii] are well attested. They were recorded in the annals of a great
people, believed by many learned and otherwise sagacious persons, and
received as religious truths by the populace; but the testimonies of
ancient records, the credulity of some learned men, and the implicit
faith of the vulgar, can never prove that to have been, which is
impossible in the nature of things ever to be.&rdquo; <i>M. Tullius
Cicero Of the Nature of the Gods</i> ... with Notes, London, 1741, p.
85. It does not appear to have been noted that in regard to this as to
another of his best-known theses, Hume develops a proposition laid down
before him.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">What Hume did was to elaborate the skeptical argument
with a power and fullness which forced attention once for all, alike in
England and on the Continent. It is not to be supposed, however, that
Hume&rsquo;s philosophy, insofar as it was strictly
skeptical&mdash;that is, suspensory&mdash;drew away deists from their
former attitude of confidence to one of absolute doubt. Nor did Hume
ever aim at such a result. What he did was to countermine the mines of
Berkeley and others, who, finding their supra-rational dogmas set aside
by rationalism, deistic or atheistic, sought to discredit at once
deistic and atheistic philosophies based on study of the external
world, and to establish their creed anew on the basis of their
subjective consciousness. As against that method, Hume showed the
futility of all apriorism alike, destroying the sham skepticism of the
Christian theists by forcing their method to its conclusions. If the
universe was to be reduced to a mere contingent of consciousness, he
calmly showed, consciousness itself was as easily reducible, on the
same principles, to a mere series of states. Idealistic skepticism,
having disposed of the universe, must make short work of the
hypostatized process of perception. Hume, knowing that strict
skepticism is practically null in life, counted on leaving the ground
cleared for experiential rationalism. And he did, insofar as he was
read. His essay, <i>Of Miracles</i> (with the rest of the
<i>Inquiries</i> of 1748&ndash;1751, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>which recast his
early <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i>, 1739), posits a principle valid
against all supernaturalism whatever; while his <i>Natural History of
Religion</i> (1757), though affirming deism, rejected the theory of a
primordial monotheism, and laid the basis of the science of Comparative
Hierology.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12115src" href="#xd21e12115"
name="xd21e12115src">133</a> Finally, his posthumous <i>Dialogues
Concerning Natural Religion</i> (1779) admit, though indirectly, the
untenableness of deism, and fall back decisively upon the atheistic or
agnostic position.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12124src" href=
"#xd21e12124" name="xd21e12124src">134</a> Like Descartes, he lacked
the heroic fibre; but like him he recast philosophy for modern Europe;

his work.</p>

<p class="par first">It is remarkable that this development of opinion
took place in that part of the British Islands where religious
fanaticism had gone furthest, and speech and thought were socially
least free. Freethought in Scotland before the middle of the
seventeenth century can have existed only as a thing furtive and
accursed; and though, as we have seen from the <i>Religio Stoici</i> of
Sir George Mackenzie, unbelief had emerged in some abundance at or
before the Restoration, only wealthy men could dare openly to avow
their deism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12139src" href="#xd21e12139"
name="xd21e12139src">135</a> Early in 1697 the clergy had actually
succeeded in getting a lad of eighteen, Thomas Aikenhead, hanged for
professing deism in general, and in particular for calling the Old
Testament &ldquo;Ezra&rsquo;s Fables,&rdquo; ridiculing the doctrines
of the Trinity and the Incarnation, and expressing the hope and belief
that Christianity would be extinct within a century.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12145src" href="#xd21e12145" name="xd21e12145src">136</a> The

broke down and pleaded penitence,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12151src"
href="#xd21e12151" name="xd21e12151src">137</a> and that the statute

denial of any of the persons of the Trinity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12166src" href="#xd21e12166" name="xd21e12166src">138</a> He had

decoy who gave him the books and made him speak as he
did.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12178src" href="#xd21e12178"
name="xd21e12178src">139</a> It would appear that a victim was very
much wanted; and Aikenhead was not allowed the help of a counsel. It is
characteristic of the deadening effect of dogmatic religion on the
heart that an act of such brutish cruelty elicited no cry of horror
from any Christian writer. At this date the clergy were hounding on the
Privy Council to new activity in trying witches; and all works of
supposed heretical tendency imported from England were confiscated in
the Edinburgh shops, among them being Thomas Burnet&rsquo;s <i>Sacred
Theory of the Earth</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12187src" href=
"#xd21e12187" name="xd21e12187src">140</a> Scottish intellectual
development had in fact been arrested by the Reformation, so that, save
for Napier&rsquo;s <i>Logarithms</i> (1614) and such a political
treatise as Rutherford&rsquo;s <i>Lex Rex</i> (1644), the nation of
Dunbar and Lyndsay produced for two centuries no secular literature of
the least value, and not even a theology of any enduring interest.
Deism, accordingly, seems in the latter half of the seventeenth and the
early part of the eighteenth century to have made fully as much
progress in Scotland as in England; and the bigoted clergy could offer
little intellectual resistance.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">As early as 1696 the Scottish General Assembly,
with theological candour, passed an Act &ldquo;against the Atheistical
opinions of the Deists.&rdquo; (<i>Abridgment of the Acts of the
General Assemblies</i>, 1721, pp. 16, 76; Cunningham, <i>Hist. of the
Ch. of Scotland</i>, ii, 313.) The opinions specified were &ldquo;The
denying of all revealed religion, the grand mysteries of the gospels
... the resurrection of the dead, and, in a word, the certainty and
authority of Scripture revelation; as also, their asserting that there
must be a mathematical evidence for each purpose ... and that Natural
Light is sufficient to Salvation.&rdquo; All this is deism, pure and
simple. But Sir W. Anstruther (a judge in the Court of Session), in the
preface to his <i>Essays Moral and Divine</i>, Edinburgh, 1710, speaks
of &ldquo;the spreading contagion of <i>atheism</i>, which threatens
the ruin of our excellent and holy religion.&rdquo; To atheism he
devotes two essays; and neither in these nor in one on the Incarnation
does he discuss deism, the arguments he handles being really atheistic.
Scottish freethought would seem thus to have gone further than English
at the period in question.</p>
<p class="par">As to the prevalence of deism, however, see the
posthumous work of Prof. Halyburton, of St. Andrews, <i>Natural
Religion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>Insufficient</i> (Edinburgh, 1714), Epist. of
Recom.; pref. pp. 25, 27, and pp. 8, 15, 19, 23, 31, etc.
Halyburton&rsquo;s treatise is interesting as showing the psychological
state of argumentative Scotch orthodoxy in his day. He professes to
repel the deistical argument throughout by reason; he follows Huet, and
concurs with Berkeley in contending that mathematics involves
anti-rational assumptions; and he takes entire satisfaction in the
execution of the lad Aikenhead for deism. Yet in a second treatise,
<i>An Essay Concerning the Nature of Faith</i>, he contends, as against
Locke and the &ldquo;Rationalists,&rdquo; that the power to believe in
the word of God is &ldquo;expressly deny&rsquo;d to man in his natural
estate,&rdquo; and is a supernatural gift. Thus the Calvinists, like
Baxter, were at bottom absolutely insincere in their profession to act
upon reason, while insolently charging insincerity on others.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Even apart from deism there had arisen a widespread
aversion to dogmatic theology and formal creeds, so that an apologist
of 1715 speaks of his day as &ldquo;a time when creeds and Confessions
of Faith are so generally decried, and not only exposed to contempt, as
useless inventions ... but are loaded by many writers of distinguished
wit and learning with the most fatal and dangerous
consequences.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12228src" href=
"#xd21e12228" name="xd21e12228src">141</a> This writer admits the

"noteref" id="xd21e12233src" href="#xd21e12233" name=
"xd21e12233src">142</a> and he speaks, on the other hand, of seeing
&ldquo;the most sacred mysteries of godliness impudently denied and
impugned&rdquo; by some, while the &ldquo;distinguishing doctrines of
Christianity are by others treacherously undermined, subtilized into an
airy phantom, or at least doubted, if not disclaimed.&rdquo;<a class=

in England, notably those of Locke, Toland, Shaftesbury, and Collins,
since in Scotland no such literature could then be published; but he
doubtless has an eye to Scottish opinion.</p>
<p class="par">While, however, the rationalism of the time could not
take book form, there are clear traces of its existence among educated
men, even apart from the general complaints of the apologists. Thus the
Professor of Medicine at Glasgow University in the opening years of the
eighteenth century, John Johnston, was a known freethinker.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12243src" href="#xd21e12243" name=
"xd21e12243src">144</a> In the way of moderate or Christian
rationalism, the teaching of the prosecuted Simson seems to have
counted for something, seeing that Francis Hutcheson at least imbibed
from him &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; views about future punishment and the
salvation of the heathen, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184"
href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>gave much offence in the
Presbyterian pulpit in Ulster.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12250src"
href="#xd21e12250" name="xd21e12250src">145</a> And Hutcheson&rsquo;s
later vindication of the ethical system of Shaftesbury in his
<i>Inquiry Concerning the Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</i> (1725) must
have tended to attract attention in Scotland to the
<i>Characteristics</i> after his instalment as a Professor at Glasgow.
In an English pamphlet, in 1732, he was satirized as introducing
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s system into a University,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12263src" href="#xd21e12263" name="xd21e12263src">146</a> and it
was from the Shaftesbury camp that the first literary expression of
freethought in Scotland was sent forth. A young Scotch deist of that
school, William Dudgeon, published in 1732 a dialogue entitled <i>The
State of the Moral World Considered</i>, wherein the optimistic
position was taken up with uncommon explicitness; and in 1739 the same
writer printed <i>A Catechism Founded upon Experience and Reason</i>,
prefaced by an Introductory Letter on Natural Religion, which takes a
distinctly anti-clerical attitude. The <i>Catechism</i> answers to its
title, save insofar as it is &agrave; priori in its theism and
optimistic in its ethic, as is another work of its author in the same
year, <i>A View of the Necessarian or Best Scheme</i>, defending the
Shaftesburyan doctrine against the criticism of Crousaz on Pope&rsquo;s
<i>Essay</i>. Still more heterodox is his little volume of
<i>Philosophical Letters Concerning the Being and Attributes of God</i>
(1737), where the doctrine goes far towards pantheism. All this
propaganda seems to have elicited only one printed reply&mdash;an
attack on his first treatise in 1732. In the letter prefaced to his
<i>Catechism</i>, however, he tells that &ldquo;the bare suspicion of
my not believing the opinions in fashion in our country hath already
caused me sufficient trouble.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12290src" href="#xd21e12290" name="xd21e12290src">147</a> His
case had in fact been raised in the Church courts, the proceedings
going through many stages in the years 1732&ndash;36; but in the end no
decision was taken,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12296src" href=
"#xd21e12296" name="xd21e12296src">148</a> and the special stress of
his rationalism in 1739 doubtless owes something alike to the
prosecution and to its collapse. Despite such hostility, he must
privately have had fair support.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12302src"
href="#xd21e12302" name="xd21e12302src">149</a></p>
<p class="par">The prosecution of Hutcheson before the Glasgow
Presbytery in 1738 reveals vividly the theological temper of the time.
He was indicted for teaching to his students &ldquo;the following two
false and dangerous doctrines: first, that the standard of moral
goodness was the promotion of the happiness of others; and, second,
that we could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>have a knowledge of good and evil without and
prior to a knowledge of God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12309src" href="#xd21e12309" name="xd21e12309src">150</a> There
has been a natural disposition on the orthodox side to suppress the
fact that such teachings were ever ecclesiastically denounced as false,
dangerous, and irreligious; and the prosecution seems to have had no
effect beyond intensifying the devotion of Hutcheson&rsquo;s students.
Among them was Adam Smith, of whom it has justly been said that,
&ldquo;if he was any man&rsquo;s disciple, he was
Hutcheson&rsquo;s,&rdquo; inasmuch as he derived from his teacher the
bases alike of his moral and political philosophy and of his deistic
optimism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12318src" href="#xd21e12318" name=
"xd21e12318src">151</a> Another prosecution soon afterwards showed that
the new influences were vitally affecting thought within the Church
itself. Hutcheson&rsquo;s friend Leechman, whom he and his party
contrived to elect as professor of theology in Glasgow University, was
in turn proceeded against (1743&ndash;44) for a sermon on Prayer, which
Hutcheson and his sympathizers pronounced &ldquo;noble,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12321src" href="#xd21e12321" name=
"xd21e12321src">152</a> but which &ldquo;resolved the efficacy of
prayer into its reflex influence on the mind of the
worshipper&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12324src" href=
"#xd21e12324" name="xd21e12324src">153</a>&mdash;a theorem which has
chronically made its appearance in the Scottish Church ever since,
still ranking as a heresy, after having brought a clerical prosecution
in the last century on at least one divine, Prof. William Knight, and
rousing a scandal against another, the late Dr. Robert
Wallace.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12331src" href="#xd21e12331" name=
"xd21e12331src">154</a></p>
<p class="par">Leechman in turn held his ground, and later became
Principal of his University; but still the orthodox in Scotland fought
bitterly against every semblance of rationalism. Even the anti-deistic
essays of Lord-President Forbes of Culloden, head of the Court of
Session, when collected<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12336src" href=
"#xd21e12336" name="xd21e12336src">155</a> and posthumously published,
were offensive to the Church as laying undue stress on reason; as
accepting the heterodox Biblical theories of Dr. John Hutchinson; and
as making the awkward admission that &ldquo;the freethinkers, with all
their perversity, generally are sensible of the social duties, and act
up to them better than others do who in other respects think more
justly than they.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12348src" href=
"#xd21e12348" name="xd21e12348src">156</a> Such an utterance from such
a dignitary told of a profound change; and, largely through the
influence of Hutcheson and Leechman on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>a generation of
students, the educated Scotland of the latter half of the eighteenth
century was in large part either &ldquo;Moderate&rdquo; or deistic.
After generations of barren controversy,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12361src" href="#xd21e12361" name="xd21e12361src">157</a> the
very aridity of the Presbyterian life intensified the recoil among the
educated classes to philosophical and historical interests, leading to
the performances of Hume, Smith, Robertson, Millar, Ferguson, and yet
others, all rationalists in method and sociologists in their
interests.</p>
<p class="par">Of these, Millar, one of Smith&rsquo;s favourite pupils,
and a table-talker of &ldquo;magical vivacity,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12369src" href="#xd21e12369" name="xd21e12369src">158</a> was

"xd21e12375src" href="#xd21e12375" name="xd21e12375src">159</a> while
Smith and Ferguson were certainly deists, as was Henry Home (the judge,
Lord Kames), who had the distinction of being attacked along with his
friend Hume in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in
1755&ndash;56. Home wrote expressly to controvert Hume, alike as to
utilitarianism and the idea of causation; but his book, <i>Essays on
Morality and Natural Religion</i> (published anonymously, 1751),
handled the thorny question of free-will in such fashion as to give no
less offence than Hume had done; and the orthodox bracketed him with
the subject of his criticism. His doctrine was indeed singular, its
purport being that there can be no free-will, but that the deity has
for wise purposes implanted in men the feeling that their wills are
free. The fact of his having been made a judge of the Court of Session
since writing his book had probably something to do with the rejection
of the whole subject by the General Assembly, and afterwards by the
Edinburgh Presbytery; but there had evidently arisen a certain
diffidence in the Church, which would be assiduously promoted by
&ldquo;moderates&rdquo; such as Principal Robertson, the historian. It
is noteworthy that, while Home and Hume thus escaped, the other Home,
John, who wrote the then admired tragedy of <i>Douglas</i>, was soon
after forced to resign his position as a minister of the Church for
that authorship, deism having apparently more friends in the fold than
drama.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12393src" href="#xd21e12393" name=
"xd21e12393src">160</a> While the theatre was thus being treated as a
place of sin, many of the churches in Scotland were the scenes of
repeated Sunday riots. A new manner of psalm-singing had been
introduced, and it frequently happened that the congregations divided
into two parties, each singing in its own way, till they came to blows.
According to one of Hume&rsquo;s biographers, unbelievers were at this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=

<p class="par">In the case of Adam Smith we have one of the leading
instances of the divorce between culture and creed in the Scotland of
that age. His intellectual tendencies, primed by Hutcheson, were
already revealing themselves when, seeking for something worth study in
the unstudious Oxford of his day, he was found by some suspicious
supervisor reading Hume&rsquo;s <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i>. The
book was seized and the student scolded.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12416src" href="#xd21e12416" name="xd21e12416src">162</a> When,
in 1751, he became Professor of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow University,
he aroused orthodox comment by abandoning the Sunday class on Christian
Evidences set up by Hutcheson, and still further, it is said, by
petitioning the Senatus to be allowed to be relieved of the duty of
opening his class with prayer.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12425src"
href="#xd21e12425" name="xd21e12425src">163</a> The permission was not
given; and the compulsory prayers were &ldquo;thought to savour
strongly of natural religion&rdquo;; while the lectures on Natural
Theology, which were part of the work of the chair, were said to lead
&ldquo;presumptuous striplings&rdquo; to hold that &ldquo;the great
truths of theology, together with the duties which man owes to God and
his neighbours, may be discovered by the light of nature without any
special revelation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12434src" href=
"#xd21e12434" name="xd21e12434src">164</a> Smith was thus well founded
in rationalism before he became personally acquainted with Voltaire and
the other French freethinkers; and the pious contemporary who deplores
his associations avows that neither before nor after his French tour

"#xd21e12437" name="xd21e12437src">165</a> It is clear, however, that
it steadily developed in a rationalistic direction. In the <i>Theory of
Moral Sentiments</i> (1759) the prevailing vein of theistic optimism is
sufficiently uncritical; but even there there emerges an apparent doubt
on the doctrine of a future state, and positive hostility to certain
ecclesiastical forms of it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12444src" href=

the average believer to see the application of a general sociological
law to his own system, there must be inferred a great change in the
intellectual climate of Scottish life before we can account for
Smith&rsquo;s general popularity at home as well as abroad after his
handling of &ldquo;enthusiasm and superstition&rdquo; in the <i>Wealth

<p class="par first">In Ireland, at least in Dublin, during the earlier
part of the century, there occurred, on a smaller scale, a similar
movement of rationalism, also largely associated with Shaftesbury. In
Dublin towards the close of the seventeenth century we have seen
Molyneux, the friend and correspondent of Locke, interested in
&ldquo;freethought,&rdquo; albeit much scared by the imprudence of
Toland. At the same period there germinated a growth of Unitarianism,
which was even more fiercely persecuted than that of Toland&rsquo;s
deism. The Rev. Thomas Emlyn, an Englishman, co-pastor of the
Protestant Dissenting Congregation of Wood Street (now Strand Street),
Dublin, was found by a Presbyterian and a Baptist to be heretical on
the subject of the Trinity, and was indicted in 1702 for blasphemy. He
was sentenced to two years&rsquo; imprisonment and a fine of
&pound;1,000, which was partly commuted on his release. He protested
that South and Sherlock and other writers on the Trinitarian
controversy might have been as justly prosecuted as he; but Irish
Protestant orthodoxy was of a keener scent than English, and Emlyn was
fain, when released, to return to his native land.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12484src" href="#xd21e12484" name="xd21e12484src">170</a> His
colleague Boyse, like many other Churchmen, wished that the unhappy
trinitarian controversy &ldquo;were buried in silence,&rdquo; but was
careful to conform doctrinally. More advanced thinkers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>had
double reason to be reticent. As usual, however, persecution provoked
the growth it sought to stifle; and after the passing of the Irish
Toleration Act of 1719, a more liberal measure than the English, there
developed in Ulster, and even in Dublin, a Unitarian movement akin to
that proceeding in England.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12497src" href=
"#xd21e12497" name="xd21e12497src">171</a> In the next generation we
find in the same city a coterie of Shaftesburyans, centring around Lord
Molesworth, the friend of Hutcheson, a man of affairs devoted to
intellectual interests. It was within a few years of his meeting
Molesworth that Hutcheson produced his <i>Inquiry</i>, championing
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s ideas;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12506src" href=
"#xd21e12506" name="xd21e12506src">172</a> and other literary men were
similarly influenced. It is even suggested that Hutcheson&rsquo;s
clerical friend Synge, whom we have seen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12513src" href="#xd21e12513" name="xd21e12513src">173</a> in 1713
attempting a ratiocinative answer to the unbelief he declared to be
abundant around him, was not only influenced by Shaftesbury through
Molesworth, but latterly &ldquo;avoided publication lest his opinions
should prejudice his career in the Church.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12519src" href="#xd21e12519" name="xd21e12519src">174</a> After
the death of Molesworth, in 1725, the movement he set up seems to have
languished;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12528src" href="#xd21e12528"
name="xd21e12528src">175</a> but, as we have seen, there were among the
Irish bishops men given to philosophic controversy, and the influence
of Berkeley cannot have been wholly obscurantist. When in 1756 we read
of the Arian Bishop Clayton<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12531src" href=
"#xd21e12531" name="xd21e12531src">176</a> proposing in the Irish House
of Lords to drop the Nicene and Athanasian creeds, we realize that in
Ireland thought was far from stagnant. The heretic bishop, however,
died (February, 1758) just as he was about to be prosecuted for the
anti-Athanasian heresies of his last book; and thenceforth Ireland
plays no noticeable part in the development of rationalism, political
interests soon taking the place of religious, with the result that
orthodoxy recovered ground.</p>
<p class="par">It cannot be doubted that the spectacle of religious
wickedness presented by the operation of the odious penal laws against
Catholics, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>and the temper of the Protestant Ascendancy
party in religious matters, had bred rational skepticism in Ireland in
the usual way. Molesworth stands out in Irish history as a founder of a
new and saner patriotism; and his doctrines would specially appeal to
men of a secular and critical way of thinking. Heretical bishops imply
heretical laymen. But the environment was unpropitious to dispassionate
thinking. The very relaxation of the Penal Code favoured a reversion to
&ldquo;moderate&rdquo; orthodoxy; and the new political strifes of the
last quarter of the century, destined as they were to be reopened in
the next, determined the course of Irish culture in another way.</p>

<p class="par first">In England, meanwhile, there was beginning the
redistribution of energies which can be seen to have prepared for the
intellectual and political reaction of the end of the century. There
had been no such victory of faith as is supposed to have been wrought
by the forensic theorem of Butler. An orthodox German observer, making
a close inquest about 1750, cites the <i>British Magazine</i> as
stating in 1749 that half the educated people were then deists; and he,
after full inquiry, agrees.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12571src" href=
"#xd21e12571" name="xd21e12571src">177</a> In the same year, Richardson
speaks tragically in the Postscriptum to <i>Clarissa</i> of seeing
&ldquo;skepticism and infidelity openly avowed, and <i>even</i>
endeavoured to be propagated from the press; the great doctrines of the
gospel brought into question&rdquo;; and he describes himself as
&ldquo;seeking to steal in with a disguised plea for religion.&rdquo;
Instead of being destroyed by the clerical defence, the deistic
movement had really penetrated the Church, which was become as
rationalistic in its methods as its function would permit, and the
educated classes, which had arrived at a state of compromise. Pope, the
chief poet of the preceding generation, had been visibly deistic in his
thinking; as Dryden had inferribly been before him; and to such
literary prestige was added the prestige of scholarship. The academic
Conyers Middleton, whose <i>Letter from Rome</i> had told so heavily
against Christianity in exposing the pagan derivations of much of
Catholicism, and who had further damaged the doctrine of inspiration in
his anonymous <i>Letter to Dr. Waterland</i> (1731), while professing
to refute Tindal, had carried to yet further lengths his service to the
critical spirit. In his famous <i>Free Inquiry</i> into the miracles of
post-apostolic Christianity (1749), again professing to strike at Rome,
he had laid the foundations of a new structure of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>comparative criticism, and had given permanent
grounds for rejecting the miracles of the sacred books.</p>
<p class="par">Middleton&rsquo;s book appeared a year after
Hume&rsquo;s essay <i>Of Miracles</i>, and it made out no such
philosophic case as Hume&rsquo;s against the concept of miracle; but it
created at once, by its literary brilliance and its cogent argument, a
sensation such as had thus far been made neither by Hume&rsquo;s
philosophic argument nor by Francklin&rsquo;s anticipation of
that.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12600src" href="#xd21e12600" name=
"xd21e12600src">178</a> Middleton had duly safeguarded himself by
positing the certainty of the gospel miracles and of those wrought by
the Apostles, on the old principle<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12603src"
href="#xd21e12603" name="xd21e12603src">179</a> that prodigies were
divinely arranged so far forth as was necessary to establish
Christianity, but no further. &ldquo;The history of the gospel,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;I hope may be true, though the history of the Church
be fabulous.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12606src" href=
"#xd21e12606" name="xd21e12606src">180</a> But his argument against
post-Apostolic miracles is so strictly naturalistic that no vigilant
reader could fail to realize its fuller bearing upon all miracles
whatsoever. With Hume and Francklin, he insisted that facts incredible
in themselves could not be established by any amount or kind of
testimony; and he suggested no measure of comparative credibility as
between the two orders of miracle. With the deists in general, he
argued that knowledge &ldquo;either of the ways or will of the
Creator&rdquo; was to be had only through study of &ldquo;that
revelation which he made of himself from the beginning in the beautiful
fabric of this visible world.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12611src" href="#xd21e12611" name="xd21e12611src">181</a> An
antagonist accordingly wrote that his theses were: &ldquo;First, that
there were no miracles wrought in the primitive Church; Secondly, that
all the primitive fathers were fools or knaves, and most of them both
one and the other. And it is easy to observe, the whole tenor of your
argument tends to prove, Thirdly, that no miracles were wrought by
Christ or his apostles; and Fourthly, that these too were fools or
knaves, or both.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12617src" href=
"#xd21e12617" name="xd21e12617src">182</a> A more temperate opponent
pressed the same point in less explosive language. Citing
Middleton&rsquo;s demand for an inductive method, this critic asks with
much point: &ldquo;What does he mean by &lsquo;deserting the path of
Nature and experience,&rsquo; but giving in to the belief of <i>any</i>
miracles, and acknowledging the reality of events contrary to the known
effects of the established Laws of Nature?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12628src" href="#xd21e12628" name="xd21e12628src">183</a></p>
<p class="par">No other answer was seriously possible. In the very act
of ostentatiously terming Tindal an &ldquo;infidel,&rdquo; Middleton
describes an answer made to him by the apologist Chapman as a sample of
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>kind of writing which did &ldquo;more hurt and
discredit&rdquo; to Christianity &ldquo;than all the attacks of its
open adversaries.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12637src" href=
"#xd21e12637" name="xd21e12637src">184</a> In support of the miracles
of the gospel and the apostolic history he offers merely conventional
pleas: against the miracles related by the Fathers he brings to bear an
incessant battery of destructive criticism. We may sum up that by the
middle of the eighteenth century the essentials of the Christian creed,
openly challenged for a generation by avowed deists, were abandoned by
not a few scholars within the pale of the Church, of whom Middleton was
merely the least reticent. After his death was published his
<i>Vindication</i> of the <i>Inquiry</i> (1751); and in his collected
works (1752) was included his <i>Reflections on the Variations or
Inconsistencies which are found among the Four Evangelists</i>, wherein
it is demonstrated that &ldquo;the belief of the inspiration and
absolute infallibility of the evangelists seems to be more absurd than
even that of transubstantiation itself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12652src" href="#xd21e12652" name="xd21e12652src">185</a> The
main grounds of orthodoxy were thus put in doubt in the name of a
critical orthodoxy. In short, the deistic movement had done what it lay
in it to do. The old evangelical or pietistic view of life was
discredited among instructed people, and in this sense it was
Christianity that had &ldquo;decayed.&rdquo; Its later recovery was
economic, not intellectual.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Thus Skelton writes in 1751 that &ldquo;our modern
apologists for Christianity often defend it on deistical
principles&rdquo; (<i>Deism Revealed</i>, pref. p. xii. Cp. vol. ii,
pp. 234, 237). See also Sir Leslie Stephen as cited above, p. 149,
<i>note</i>; and Gostwick, <i>German Culture and Christianity</i>,
1882, pp. 33&ndash;36.</p>
<p class="par">An interesting instance of liberalizing orthodoxy is
furnished by the Rev. Arthur Ashley Sykes, who contributed many volumes
to the general deistic discussion, some of them anonymously. In the
preface to his <i>Essay on the Truth of the Christian Religion</i>
(1732; 2nd ed. enlarged, 1755) Sykes remarks that &ldquo;since ...
systematical opinions have been received and embraced in such a manner
that it has not been safe to contradict them, the burden of vindicating
Christianity has been very much increased. Its friends have been much
embarrassed through fear of speaking against <i>local truths</i>; and
its adversaries have so successfully attacked those weaknesses that
Christianity itself has been deemed indefensible, when in reality the
follies of Christians alone have been so.&rdquo; Were Christians left
to the simple doctrines of Christ and the Apostles, he contends,
Infidelity could make no converts. And at the close of the book he
writes: &ldquo;Would to God that Christians would be content with the
plainness and simplicity of the gospel.... That they would not vend
under the name of evangelical truth the absurd and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>contradictory schemes of ignorant or wicked men!
That they would part with that load of rubbish which makes thinking men
almost sink under the weight, and gives too great a handle for
Infidelity!&rdquo; Such writing could not give satisfaction to the
ecclesiastical authorities; and as little could Sykes&rsquo;s
remarkable admission (<i>The Principles and Connection of Natural and
Revealed Religion</i>, 1740, p. 242): &ldquo;When the advantages of
revelation are to be specified, I cannot conceive that it should be
maintained as necessary to <i>fix a rule of morality</i>. For what one
principle of morality is there which the heathen moralists had not
asserted or maintained? Before ever any revelation is offered to
mankind they are supposed to be so well acquainted with moral truths as
from them to judge of the truth of the revelation itself.&rdquo; Again
he writes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nor can revelation be necessary to <i>ascertain
religion</i>. For religion consisting in nothing but doing our duties
from a sense of the being of God, revelation is not necessary to this
end, unless it be said that we cannot know that there is a God, and
what our duties are, without it. <i>Reason</i> will teach us that there
is a <i>God</i> ... that we are to be just and charitable to our
neighbours; that we are to be temperate and sober in ourselves&rdquo;
(<i>id.</i> p. 244).</p>
<p class="par">This is simple Shaftesburyan deism, and all that the
apologist goes on to contend for is that revelation &ldquo;contains
<i>motives</i> and <i>reasons</i> for the practice of what is right,
more and different from what natural reason without this help can
suggest.&rdquo; He seems, however, to have believed in miracles, though
an anonymous <i>Essay on the Nature, Design, and Origin of
Sacrifices</i> (1748) which is ascribed to him quietly undermines the
whole evangelical doctrine. Throughout, he is remarkable for the
amenity of his tone towards &ldquo;infidels.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Balguy, a man of less ability, is notably latitudinarian
in his theology. In the very act of criticizing the deists, he
complains of Locke&rsquo;s arbitrariness in deriving morality from the
will of God. Religion, he argues, is so derived, but morality is
inherent in the whole nature of things, and is the same for God and
men. This position, common to the school of Clarke, is at bottom that
of Shaftesbury and the Naturalists. All that Balguy says for religion
is that a doctrine of rewards and punishments is necessary to stimulate
the average moral sense; and that the Christian story of the
condescension of Omnipotence in coming to earth and suffering misery
for man&rsquo;s sake ought to overwhelm the imagination! (See <i>A
Letter to a Deist</i>, 2nd ed. 1730, pp. 5, 14, 15, 31; <i>Foundation
of Moral Goodness</i>, pt. ii, 1729, p. 41 <i>sq.</i>)</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The next intellectual step in natural course would have
been a revision of the deistic assumptions, insofar, that is, as
certain positive assumptions were common to the deists. But, as we have
seen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>certain fresh issues were raised as among the
deists themselves. In addition to those above noted, there was the
profoundly important one as to ethics. Shaftesbury, who rejected the
religious basis, held a creed of optimism; and this optimism was
assailed by Mandeville, who in consequence was opposed as warmly by the
deist Hutcheson and others as by Law and Berkeley. To grapple with this
problem, and with the underlying cosmic problem, there was needed at
least as much general mental activity as went to the antecedent
discussion; and the main activity of the nation was now being otherwise
directed. The negative process, the impeachment of Christian
supernaturalism, had been accomplished so far as the current arguments
went. Toland and Collins had fought the battle of free discussion,
forcing ratiocination on the Church; Collins had shaken the creed of
prophecy; Shaftesbury had impugned the religious conception of morals;
and Mandeville had done so more profoundly, laying the foundations of
scientific utilitarianism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12726src" href=
"#xd21e12726" name="xd21e12726src">186</a> So effective had been the
utilitarian propaganda in general that the orthodox Brown (author of
the once famous <i>Estimate</i> of the life of his countrymen), in his
criticism of Shaftesbury (1751), wrote as a pure utilitarian against an
inconsistent one, and defended Christianity on strictly utilitarian
lines. Woolston, following up Collins, had shaken the faith in New
Testament miracles; Middleton had done it afresh with all the decorum
that Woolston lacked; and Hume had laid down with masterly clearness
the philosophic principle which rebuts all attempts to prove miracles
as such.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12735src" href="#xd21e12735" name=
"xd21e12735src">187</a> Tindal had clinched the case for
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; theism as against revelationism; and the later
deists, notably Morgan, had to some extent combined these
results.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12741src" href="#xd21e12741" name=

<p class="par first">To carry intellectual progress much further there
was needed a general movement of scientific study and a reform in
education. The translation of La Mettrie&rsquo;s <i>Man a Machine</i>
(1749)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12758src" href="#xd21e12758" name=

infidelity overspread the land,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

what appetite there was for such a discussion. There had begun a change
in the prevailing mental life, a diversion of interest from ideas as
such to political and mercantile interests. The middle and latter part
of the eighteenth century is the period of the rise of (1) the new
machine industries, and (2) the new imperialistic policy of
Chatham.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12766src" href="#xd21e12766" name=

the reaction was not one of mere fatigue over deism we have already
seen. It was a general diversion of energy, analogous to what had
previously taken place in France in the reign of Louis XIV. As the poet
Gray, himself orthodox, put the case in 1754, &ldquo;the mode of
freethinking has given place to the mode of not thinking at
all.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12779src" href="#xd21e12779"
name="xd21e12779src">192</a> In Hume&rsquo;s opinion the general pitch

"noteref" id="xd21e12785src" href="#xd21e12785" name=
"xd21e12785src">193</a> This state of things of course was favourable
to religious revival; but what took place was rather a new growth of
emotional pietism in the new industrial masses (the population being
now on a rapid increase), under the ministry of the Wesleys and
Whitefield, and a further growth of similar religion in the new
provincial middle-class that grew up on the industrial basis. The
universities all the while were at the lowest ebb of culture, but
officially rabid against philosophic freethinking.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12791src" href="#xd21e12791" name="xd21e12791src">194</a></p>
<p class="par">It would be a great mistake, however, to suppose that
all this meant a dying out of deism among the educated classes. The
statement of Goldsmith, about 1760, that deists in general &ldquo;have
been driven into a confession of the necessity of revelation, or an
open avowal of atheism,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12808src"
href="#xd21e12808" name="xd21e12808src">195</a> is not to be taken
seriously. Goldsmith, whose own orthodoxy is very doubtful, had a
whimsical theory that skepticism, though it might not injure morals,
has a &ldquo;manifest tendency to subvert the literary merits&rdquo; of
any country;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12813src" href="#xd21e12813"
name="xd21e12813src">196</a> and argued accordingly. Deism, remaining
fashionable, did but fall partly into the background of living
interests, the more concrete issues of politics and the new imaginative
literature occupying the foreground. It was early in the reign of
George III that Sir William Blackstone, having had the curiosity to
listen in succession <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196"
name="pb196">196</a>]</span>to the preaching of every clergyman in
London, &ldquo;did not hear a single discourse which had more
Christianity in it than the writings of Cicero,&rdquo; and declared
that it would have been impossible for him to discover from what he
heard whether the preacher were a follower of Confucius, of Mahomet, or
of Christ.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12826src" href="#xd21e12826"
name="xd21e12826src">197</a> When the Church was thus deistic, the
educated laity can have been no less so. The literary status of deism
after 1750 was really higher than ever. It was now represented by Hume;
by <span class="sc">Adam Smith</span> (<i>Moral Sentiments</i>, 1759);
by the scholarship of Conyers Middleton; and by the posthumous works
(1752&ndash;54) of Lord <span class="sc">Bolingbroke</span>, who,
albeit more of a debater than a thinker, debated often with masterly
skill, in a style unmatched for harmony and energetic grace, which had
already won him a great literary prestige, though the visible
insincerity of his character, and the habit of browbeating, always
countervailed his charm. His influence, commonly belittled, was much
greater than writers like Johnson would admit; and it went deep.
Voltaire, who had been his intimate, tells<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12842src" href="#xd21e12842" name="xd21e12842src">198</a> that he
had known some young pupils of Bolingbroke who altogether denied the
historic actuality of the Gospel Jesus&mdash;a stretch of criticism
beyond the assimilative power of that age.</p>
<p class="par">His motive to write for posthumous publication, however,
seems rather to have been the venting of his tumultuous feelings than
any philosophic purpose. An overweening deist, he is yet at much pains
to disparage the &agrave; priori argument for deism, bestowing some of
his most violent epithets on Dr. Samuel Clarke, who seems to have
exasperated him in politics. But his castigation of
&ldquo;divines&rdquo; is tolerably impartial on that side; and he is
largely concerned to deprive them of grounds for their functions,
though he finally insists that churches are necessary for purposes of
public moral teaching. His own teachings represent an effort to
rationalize deism. The God whom he affirms is to be conceived or
described only as omnipotent and omniscient (or all-wise), not as good
or benevolent any more than as vindictive. Thus he had assimilated part
of the Spinozistic and the atheistic case against anthropomorphism,
while still using anthropomorphic language on the score that &ldquo;we
must speak of God after the manner of men.&rdquo; Beyond this point he
compromises to the extent of denying special while admitting collective
or social providences; though he is positive in his denial of the
actuality or the moral need of a future state. As to morals he takes
the ordinary deistic line, putting the innate &ldquo;law of
nature&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>as the sufficient and only revelation by the
deity to his creatures. On the basis of that inner testimony he rejects
the Old Testament as utterly unworthy of deity, but endorses the
universal morality found in the gospels, while rejecting their
theology. It was very much the deism of Voltaire, save that it made
more concessions to anti-theistic logic.</p>
<p class="par">The weak side of Bolingbroke&rsquo;s polemic was its
inconsistency&mdash;a flaw deriving from his character. In the spirit
of a partisan debater he threw out at any point any criticism that
appeared for the moment plausible; and, having no scientific basis or
saving rectitude, would elsewhere take up another and a contradictory
position. Careful antagonists could thus discredit him by mere
collation of his own utterances.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12853src"
href="#xd21e12853" name="xd21e12853src">199</a> But, the enemy being no
more consistent than he, his influence was not seriously affected in
the world of ordinary readers; and much of his attack on
&ldquo;divines,&rdquo; on dogmas, and on Old Testament morality must
have appealed to many, thus carrying on the discredit of orthodoxy in
general. Leland devoted to him an entire volume of his <i>View of the
Principal Deistical Writers</i>, and in all bestows more space upon him
than on all the others together&mdash;a sufficient indication of his
vogue.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">In his lifetime, however, Bolingbroke had been
extremely careful to avoid compromising himself. Mr. Arthur Hassall, in
his generally excellent monograph on Bolingbroke (Statesmen Series,
1889, p. 226), writes, in answer to the attack of Johnson, that
&ldquo;Bolingbroke, during his lifetime, had never scrupled to publish
criticisms, remarkable for their freedom, on religious subjects.&rdquo;
I cannot gather to what he refers; and Mr. Walter Sichel, in his
copious biography (2 vols. 1901&ndash;1902), indicates no such
publications. The <i>Letters on the Study and Use of History</i>, which
contain (Lett. iii, sect. 2) a skeptical discussion of the Pentateuch
as history, though written in 1735&ndash;36, were only posthumously
published, in 1752. The <i lang="fr">Examen Important de Milord
Bolingbroke</i>, produced by Voltaire in 1767, but dated 1736, is
Voltaire&rsquo;s own work, based on Bolingbroke. In his letter to Swift
of September 12, 1724 (<i>Swift&rsquo;s Works</i>, Scott&rsquo;s ed.
1824, xvi, 448&ndash;49), Bolingbroke angrily repudiates the title of
<i lang="fr">esprit fort</i>, declaring, in the very temper in which
pious posterity has aspersed himself, that &ldquo;such are the pests of
society, because they endeavour to loosen the bands of it.... I
therefore not only disown, but I detest, this character.&rdquo; In this
letter he even affects to believe in &ldquo;the truth of the divine
revelation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>of Christianity.&rdquo; He began to write his
essays, it is true, before his withdrawal to France in 1735, but with
no intention of speedily publishing them. In his <i>Letter to Mr.
Pope</i> (published with the <i>Letter to Wyndham</i>, 1753), p. 481,
he writes: &ldquo;I have been a martyr of faction in politics, and have
no vocation to be so in philosophy.&rdquo; Cp. pp. 485&ndash;86. It is
thus a complete blunder on the part of Bagehot to say (<i>Literary
Studies</i>, Hutton&rsquo;s ed. iii, 137) that Butler&rsquo;s
<i>Analogy</i>, published in 1736, was &ldquo;designed as a confutation
of Shaftesbury <i>and Bolingbroke</i>.&rdquo; It is even said (Warton,
<i>Essay on Pope</i>, 4th ed. ii, 294&ndash;95) that Pope did not know
Bolingbroke&rsquo;s real opinions; but Pope&rsquo;s untruthfulness was
such as to discredit such a statement. Cp. Bolingbroke&rsquo;s
<i>Letter</i> as cited, p. 521, and his <i>Philosophical Works</i>,
8vo-ed. 1754, ii, 405. It is noteworthy that a volume of controversial
sermons entitled <i>A Preservative against unsettled notions and Want
of Principles in Religion</i>, so entirely stupid in its apologetics as
to be at times positively entertaining, was published in 1715 by Joseph
Trapp, M.A., &ldquo;Chaplain to the Right Honble. The Lord Viscount
Bolingbroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In seeking to estimate Bolingbroke&rsquo;s posthumous
influence we have to remember that after the publication of his works
the orthodox members of his own party, who otherwise would have
forgiven him all his vices and insincerities, have held him up to
hatred. Scott, for instance, founding on Bolingbroke&rsquo;s own
dishonest denunciation of freethinkers as men seeking to loosen the
bands of society, pronounced his arrangement for the posthumous issue
of his works &ldquo;an act of wickedness more purely diabolical than
any hitherto upon record in the history of any age or nation&rdquo;
(Note to Bolingbroke&rsquo;s letter above cited in <i>Swift&rsquo;s
Works</i>, xvi, 450). It would be an error, on the other hand, to class
him among either the great sociologists or the great philosophers. Mr.
Sichel undertakes to show (vol. ii, ch. x) that Bolingbroke had
stimulated Gibbon to a considerable extent in his treatment of early
Christianity. This is in itself quite probable, and some of the
parallels cited are noteworthy; but Mr. Sichel, who always writes as a
panegyrist, makes no attempt to trace the common French sources for
both. He does show that Voltaire manipulated Bolingbroke&rsquo;s
opinions in reproducing them. But he does not critically recognize the
incoherence of Bolingbroke&rsquo;s eloquent treatises. Mr.
Hassall&rsquo;s summary is nearer the truth; but that in turn does not
note how well fitted was Bolingbroke&rsquo;s swift and graceful
declamation to do its work with the general public, which (if it
accepted him at all) would make small account of
self-contradiction.</p>

deism could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>not be regarded as in the least degree written
down. In 1765, in fact, we find Diderot recounting, on the authority of
d&rsquo;Holbach, who had just returned from a visit to this country,
that &ldquo;the Christian religion is nearly extinct in England. The
deists are innumerable; there are almost no atheists; those who are so
conceal it. An atheist and a scoundrel are almost synonymous terms for
them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12927src" href="#xd21e12927"
name="xd21e12927src">200</a> Nor did the output of deistic literature
end with the posthumous works of Bolingbroke. These were followed by
translations of the new writings of <span class=

"#xd21e12935" name="xd21e12935src">201</a> who had assimilated the
whole propaganda of English deism, and gave it out anew with a wit and
brilliancy hitherto unknown in argumentative and critical literature.
The freethinking of the third quarter of the century, though kept
secondary to more pressing questions, was thus at least as deeply
rooted and as convinced as that of the first quarter; and it was
probably not much less common among educated men, though new social
influences caused it to be more decried.</p>
<p class="par">The hapless Chatterton, fatally precocious, a boy in
years and experience of life, a man in understanding at seventeen,
incurred posthumous obloquy more for his &ldquo;infidelity&rdquo; than
for the harmless literary forgeries which reveal his poetic affinity to
a less prosaic age. It is a memorable fact that this first recovery of
the lost note of imaginative poetry in that &ldquo;age of prose and
reason&rdquo; is the exploit of a boy whose mind was as independently
&ldquo;freethinking&rdquo; on current religion as it was original even
in its imitative reversion to the poetics of the past. Turning away
from the impossible mythicism and mysticism of the Tudor and Stuart
literatures, as from the fanaticism of the Puritans, the changing
English world after the Restoration had let fall the artistic
possession of imaginative feeling and style which was the true glory of
the time of Renascence. The ill-strung genius of Chatterton seems to
have been the first to reunite the sense of romantic beauty with the
spirit of critical reason. He was a convinced deist, avowing in his
verse, in his pathetic will (1770), in a late letter, and at times in
his talk, that he was &ldquo;no Christian,&rdquo; and contemning the
ethic of Scripture history and the absurdity of literal
inspiration.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12943src" href="#xd21e12943"
name="xd21e12943src">202</a> Many there must have been who went as far,
with less courage of avowal.</p>
<p class="par">What was lacking to the age, once more, was a social
foundation on which it could not only endure but develop. In a nation
of which the majority had no intellectual culture, such a foundation

"xd21e12979src">207</a> and thereafter the multiplication was still
more rapid. There was thus a positive fall in the culture standards of
the majority of the people. According to Massey, &ldquo;hardly any
tradesman in 1760 had more instruction than qualified him to add up a
bill&rdquo;; and &ldquo;a labourer, mechanic, or domestic servant who
could read or write possessed a rare accomplishment.&rdquo;<a class=

<div class="par">In the view of life which accepted this state of
things the educated deists seem to have shared; at least, there is no
record of any agitation by them for betterment. The state of political
thought was typified in the struggle over &ldquo;Wilkes and
Liberty,&rdquo; from which cool temperaments like Hume&rsquo;s turned
away in contempt; and it is significant that poor men were persecuted
for freethinking while the better-placed went free. <span class=
"sc">Jacob Ilive</span>, for denying in a pamphlet (1753) the truth of
revelation, was pilloried thrice, and sent to hard labour for three
years. In 1754 the Grand Jury of Middlesex &ldquo;presented&rdquo; the
editor and publisher of Bolingbroke&rsquo;s posthumous works<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12995src" href="#xd21e12995" name=
"xd21e12995src">209</a>&mdash;a distinction that in the previous
generation had been bestowed on Mandeville&rsquo;s <i>Fable of the
Bees</i>; and in 1761, as before noted, Peter Annet, aged seventy, was
pilloried twice and sent to prison for discrediting the Pentateuch; as
if that were a more serious offence than his former attacks on the
gospels and on St. Paul. The personal influence of George III, further,
told everywhere against freethinking; and the revival of penalties
would have checked publishing even if there had been no withdrawal of
interest to politics.

<p class="par">Of the work here noted a considerable amount was done by
Unitarians, Evanson being of that persuasion, though at the time of
writing his earlier Unitarian works he was an Anglican vicar.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13165src" href="#xd21e13165" name=
"xd21e13165src">211</a> During the first half of the eighteenth
century, despite the movement at the end of the seventeenth, specific
anti-Trinitarianism was not much in evidence, the deistic controversy
holding the foreground. But gradually Unitarianism made fresh headway.
One dissenting clergyman, Martin Tomkyns, who had been dismissed by his
congregation at Stoke Newington for his &ldquo;Arian or Unitarian
opinions,&rdquo; published in 1722 <i>A Sober Appeal to a Turk or an
Indian, concerning the plain sense of the Trinity</i>, in reply to the
treatise of Dr. Isaac Watts on <i>The Christian Doctrine of the
Trinity</i>. A second edition of Tomkyns&rsquo;s book appeared in 1748,
with a further reply to Watts&rsquo;s <i>Dissertations</i> of 1724. The
result seems to have been an unsettlement of the orthodoxy of the
hymn-writer. There is express testimony from Dr. Lardner, a very
trustworthy witness, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>Watts in his latter years,
&ldquo;before he was seized with an imbecility of his faculties,&rdquo;
was substantially a Unitarian. His special papers on the subject were
suppressed by his executors; but the full text of his <i>Solemn Address
to the Great and Blessed God</i> goes far to bear out Lardner&rsquo;s
express assertion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13186src" href=
"#xd21e13186" name="xd21e13186src">212</a> Other prominent religionists
were more outspoken. The most distinguished names associated with the
position were those of Lardner and Priestley, of whom the former,
trained as a simple &ldquo;dissenter,&rdquo; avowedly reached his
conclusions without much reference to Socinian literature;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13198src" href="#xd21e13198" name=
"xd21e13198src">213</a> and the second, who was similarly educated, no
less independently gave up the doctrines of the Atonement and the
Trinity, passing later from the Arian to the Socinian position after
reading Lardner&rsquo;s <i>Letter on the Logos</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e13209src" href="#xd21e13209" name="xd21e13209src">214</a> As
Priestley derived his determinism from Collins,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13217src" href="#xd21e13217" name="xd21e13217src">215</a> it
would appear that the deistical movement had set up a general habit of
reasoning which thus wrought even on Christians who, like Lardner and
Priestley, undertook to rebut the objections of unbelievers to their
faith. A generally rationalistic influence is to be noted in the works
of the Unitarian Antip&aelig;dobaptist Dr. Joshua Toulmin, author of
lives of Socinus (1777) and Biddle (1789), and many other solid works,
including a sermon on &ldquo;The Injustice of classing Unitarians with
Deists and Infidels&rdquo; (1797). In his case the
&ldquo;classing&rdquo; was certainly inconvenient. In 1791 the effigy
of Paine was burned before his door, and his windows broken. His house
was saved by being closely guarded; but his businesses of schoolkeeping
and bookselling had to be given up. It thus becomes intelligible how,
after a period in which Dissent, contemned by the State Church, learned
to criticize that Church&rsquo;s creed, there emerged in England
towards the close of the eighteenth century a fresh movement of
specific Unitarianism.</p>
<p class="par">Evanson and Toulmin were scholarly writers, though
without the large learning of Lardner and the propagandist energy and
reputation of Priestley; and the Unitarian movement, in a quiet
fashion, made a numerical progress out of all proportion to that of
orthodoxy. It owed much of its immunity at this stage, doubtless, to
the large element of tacit deism in the Church; and apart from the
scholarly work of Lardner both Priestley and Evanson did something for
New Testament criticism, as well as towards the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>clearing-up of Christian origins. Evanson was
actually prosecuted in 1773, on local initiative, for a sermon of
Unitarian character delivered by him in the parish church of Tewkesbury
on Easter-Day of 1771; and, what is much more remarkable, members of
his congregation, at a single defence-meeting in an inn, collected
&pound;150 to meet his costs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13226src"
href="#xd21e13226" name="xd21e13226src">216</a> Five years later he had
given up the belief in eternal punishment, though continuing to believe
in &ldquo;long protracted&rdquo; misery for sinners.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e13229src" href="#xd21e13229" name="xd21e13229src">217</a>
Still later, after producing his <i>Dissonance</i>, he became
uncommonly drastic in his handling of the Canon. He lived well into the
nineteenth century, and published in 1805 a vigorous tractate,
<i>Second Thoughts on the Trinity, recommended to the Right Reverend
the Lord Bishop of Gloucester</i>. In that he treats the First Gospel
as a forgery of the second century. The method is indiscriminating, and
the author lays much uncritical stress upon prophecy. On the whole, the
Unitarian contribution to rational thought, then as later, was
secondary or ancillary, though on the side of historical investigation
it was important. Lardner&rsquo;s candour is as uncommon as his
learning; and Priestley<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13239src" href=
"#xd21e13239" name="xd21e13239src">218</a> and Evanson have a solvent
virtue.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13242src" href="#xd21e13242" name=
"xd21e13242src">219</a> In all three the limitation lies in the fixed
adherence to the concept of revelation, which withheld them from
radical rationalism even as it did from Arianism. Evanson&rsquo;s
ultra-orthodox acceptance of the Apocalypse is significant of his
limitations; and Priestley&rsquo;s calibre is indicated by his
life-long refusal to accept the true scientific inference from his own
discovery of oxygen. A more pronounced evolution was that of the Welsh
deist David Williams, who, after publishing two volumes of <i>Sermons
on Religious Hypocrisy</i> (1774), gave up his post as a dissenting
preacher, and, in conjunction with Franklin and other freethinkers,
opened a short-lived deistic chapel in Margaret Street, London (1776),
where there was used a &ldquo;Liturgy on the Universal Principles of
Religion and Morality.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13251src"

<p class="par first">On the other hand, apart from the revival of
popular religion under Whitefield and Wesley, which won multitudes of
the people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>whom no higher culture could reach, there was no
recovery of educated belief upon intellectual lines; though there was a
steady detachment of energy to the new activities of conquest and
commerce which mark the second half of the eighteenth century in
England. On this state of things supervened the massive performance of
the greatest historical writer England had yet produced. <span class=
"sc">Gibbon</span>, educated not by Oxford but by the recent scholarly
literature of France, had as a mere boy seen, on reading Bossuet, the
theoretic weakness of Protestantism, and had straightway professed
Romanism. Shaken as to that by a skilled Swiss Protestant, he speedily
became a rationalist pure and simple, with as little of the dregs of
deism in him as any writer of his age; and his great work begins, or
rather signalizes (since Hume and Robertson preceded him), a new era of
historical writing, not merely by its sociological treatment of the
rise of Christianity, but by its absolutely anti-theological handling
of all things.</p>
<p class="par">The importance of the new approach may be at once
measured by the zeal of the opposition. In no case, perhaps, has the
essentially passional character of religious resistance to new thought
been more vividly shown than in that of the contemporary attacks upon
Gibbon&rsquo;s <i>History</i>. There is not to be found in
controversial literature such another annihilating rejoinder as was
made by Gibbon to the clerical zealots who undertook to confound him on
points of scholarship, history, and ratiocination. The contrast between
the mostly spiteful incompetence of the attack and the finished mastery
of the reply put the faith at a disadvantage from which it never
intellectually recovered, though other forces reinstated it socially.
By the admission of Macaulay, who thought Gibbon &ldquo;most
unfair&rdquo; to religion, the whole troup of his assailants are now
&ldquo;utterly forgotten&rdquo;; and those orthodox commentators who
later sought to improve on their criticism have in turn, with a notable
uniformity, been rebutted by their successors; till Gibbon&rsquo;s
critical section ranks as the first systematically scientific handling
of the problem of the rise of Christianity. He can be seen to have
profited by all the relevant deistic work done before him, learning
alike from Toland, from Middleton, and from Bolingbroke; though his
acknowledgments are mostly paid to respectable Protestants and
Catholics, as Basnage, Beausobre, Lardner, Mosheim, and Tillemont; and
the sheer solidity of the work has sustained it against a hundred years
of hostile comment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13269src" href=
"#xd21e13269" name="xd21e13269src">221</a> While Gibbon was thus
earning for his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205"
name="pb205">205</a>]</span>country a new literary distinction, the
orthodox interest was concerned above all things to convict him of
ignorance, incompetence, and dishonesty; and Davis, the one of his
assailants who most fully manifested all of these qualities, and who
will long be remembered solely from Gibbon&rsquo;s deadly exposure, was
rewarded with a royal pension. Another, Apthorp, received an
archiepiscopal living; while Chelsum, the one who almost alone wrote
against him like a gentleman, got nothing. But no cabal could avail to
prevent the instant recognition, at home and abroad, of the advent of a
new master in history; and in the worst times of reaction which
followed, the <i>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire</i> impassively defied the claims of the ruling creed.</p>
<p class="par">In a literary world which was eagerly reading
Gibbon<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13282src" href="#xd21e13282" name=

the readers were few the indifferentists were many. Evanson could
truthfully write to Bishop Hurd in 1777 that &ldquo;That general
unbelief of revealed religion among the higher orders of our
countrymen, which, however your Lordship and I might differ in our
manner of accounting for it, is too notorious for either of us to doubt
of, hath, by a necessary consequence, produced in the majority of our

Parliament, all the while, was the Prime Minister, <span class=
"sc">William Pitt</span> the younger, an agnostic deist.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Whether or not the elder Pitt was a deist, the
younger gave very plain signs of being at least no more. Gladstone
(<i>Studies subsidiary to the Works of Bishop Butler</i>, ed. 1896, pp.
30&ndash;33) has sought to discredit the recorded testimony of
Wilberforce (<i>Life of Wilberforce</i>, 1838, i, 98) that Pitt told
him &ldquo;Bishop <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206"
name="pb206">206</a>]</span>Butler&rsquo;s work raised in his mind more
doubts than it had answered.&rdquo; Gladstone points to another passage
in Wilberforce&rsquo;s diary which states that Pitt &ldquo;commended
Butler&rsquo;s <i>Analogy</i>&rdquo; (<i>Life</i>, i, 90). But the
context shows that Pitt had commended the book for the express purpose
of turning Wilberforce&rsquo;s mind from its evangelical bias.
Wilberforce was never a deist, and the purpose accordingly could not
have been to make him orthodox. The two testimonies are thus perfectly
consistent; especially when we note the further statement credibly
reported to have been made by Wilberforce (<i>Life</i>, i, 95), that
Pitt later &ldquo;<i>tried to reason me out of my
convictions</i>.&rdquo; We have yet further the emphatic declaration of
Pitt&rsquo;s niece, Lady Hester Stanhope, that he &ldquo;never went to
church in his life ... never even talked about religion&rdquo;
(<i>Memoirs of Lady Hester Stanhope</i>, 1845, iii, 166&ndash;67). This
was said in emphatic denial of the genuineness of the unctuous
death-bed speech put in Pitt&rsquo;s mouth by Gifford. Lady
Hester&rsquo;s high veracity is accredited by her physician (<i>Travels
of Lady Hester Stanhope</i>, 1846, i, pref. p. 11). No such character
can be given to the conventional English biography of the period.</p>
<p class="par">We have further to note the circumstantial account by
Wilberforce in his letter to the Rev. S. Gisborne immediately after
Pitt&rsquo;s death (<i>Correspondence</i>, 1840, ii, 69&ndash;70),
giving the details he had had in confidence from the Bishop of Lincoln.
They are to the effect that, after some demur on Pitt&rsquo;s part
(&ldquo;that he was not worthy to offer up any prayer, or was too
weak,&rdquo;) the Bishop prayed with him once. Wilberforce adds his
&ldquo;fear&rdquo; that &ldquo;no further religious intercourse took
place before or after, <i>and I own I thought what was inserted in the
papers impossible to be true</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">There is clear testimony that Charles James Fox,
Pitt&rsquo;s illustrious rival, was no more of a believer than
he,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13367src" href="#xd21e13367" name=
"xd21e13367src">228</a> though equally careful to make no profession of

levities of political action.</p>
<p class="par">Among thinking men too the nascent science of geology
was setting up a new criticism of &ldquo;revelation&rdquo;&mdash;this
twenty years before the issue of the epoch-making works of
Hutton.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13390src" href="#xd21e13390" name=

Mirabaud, challenging the Biblical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207"

the earth. The new phase of &ldquo;infidelity&rdquo; was of course
furiously denounced, one of the most angry and most absurd of its
opponents being the poet Cowper.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13401src"
href="#xd21e13401" name="xd21e13401src">231</a> Still rationalism
persisted. Paley, writing in 1786, protests that &ldquo;Infidelity is
now served up in every shape that is likely to allure, surprise, or
beguile the imagination, in a fable, a tale, a novel, or a poem, in
interspersed or broken hints, remote and oblique surmises, in books of
travel, of philosophy, of natural history&mdash;in a word, in any form

disquisition.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13407src" href=
"#xd21e13407" name="xd21e13407src">232</a> The orthodox Dr. J. Ogilvie,
in the introduction to his <i>Inquiry into the Causes of the Infidelity
and Skepticism of the Times</i> (1783), begins: &ldquo;That the
opinions of the deists and skeptics have spread more universally during
a part of the last century and in the present than at any former
&aelig;ra since the resurrection of letters, is a truth to which the
friends and the enemies of religion will give their suffrage without
hesitation.&rdquo; In short, until the general reversal of all progress
which followed on the French Revolution, there had been no such change
of opinion as Burke alleged.</p>
<p class="par">One of the most popular poets and writers of the day was
the celebrated <span class="sc">Erasmus Darwin</span>, a deist, whose
<i>Zoonomia</i> (1794) brought on him the charge of atheism, as it well
might. However he might poetize about the Creator, Dr. Darwin in his
verse and prose alike laid the foundations of the doctrines of the
transmutation of species and the aqueous origin of simple forms of life
which evolved into higher forms; though the idea of the descent of man
from a simian species had been broached before him by Buffon and
Helv&eacute;tius in France, and Lords Kames and Monboddo in Scotland.
The idea of a <i>Natura naturans</i> was indeed ancient; but it has
been authoritatively said of Erasmus Darwin that &ldquo;he was the
first who proposed and consistently carried out a well-rounded theory
with regard to the development of the living world&mdash;a merit which
shines forth more brilliantly when we compare it with the vacillating
and confused attempts of Buffon, Linn&aelig;us, and Goethe. It is the
idea of a power working from within the organisms to improve their
natural position&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13426src" href=

are plainly unevangelical;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13483src" href=

belief in a benevolent God and in a future state that he cannot be
supposed to have held the further beliefs which his orthodox
correspondents would wish him to express. A rationalistic habit is

<p class="par first">With the infelicity in prediction which is so much
commoner with him than the &ldquo;prescience&rdquo; for which he is
praised, Burke had announced that the whole deist school &ldquo;repose
in lasting oblivion.&rdquo; The proposition would be much more true of
999 out of every thousand writers on behalf of Christianity. It is
characteristic of Burke, however, that he does not name Shaftesbury, a
Whig nobleman of the sacred period.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13519src" href="#xd21e13519" name="xd21e13519src">241</a> A
seeming justice was given to Burke&rsquo;s phrase by the undoubted
reaction which took place immediately afterwards. In the vast panic
which followed on the French Revolution, the multitude of mediocre
minds in the middle and upper classes, formerly deistic or indifferent,
took fright at unbelief as something now visibly connected with
democracy and regicide; new money endowments were rapidly bestowed on
the Church; and orthodoxy became fashionable on political grounds just
as skepticism had become fashionable at the Restoration. Class interest
and political prejudice wrought much in both cases; only in opposite
directions. Democracy was no longer Bibliolatrous, therefore
aristocracy was fain to became so, or at least to grow respectful
towards the Church as a means of social control. Gibbon, in his closing
years, went with the stream. And as religious wars have always tended
to discredit religion, so a war partly associated with the freethinking
of the French revolutionists tended to discredit freethought. The
brutish wrecking of Priestley&rsquo;s house and library and chapel by a
mob at Birmingham in 1791 was but an extreme <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>manifestation of a reaction which affected every
form of mental life. But while Priestley went to die in the United
States, another English exile, temporarily returned thence to his
native land, was opening a new era of popular rationalism. Even in the
height of the revolutionary tumult, and while Burke was blustering
about the disappearance of unbelief, <span class="sc">Thomas
Paine</span> was laying deep and wide the English foundations of a new
democratic freethought; and the upper-class reaction in the nature of
the case was doomed to impermanency, though it was to arrest English
intellectual progress for over a generation. The French Revolution had
re-introduced freethought as a vital issue, even in causing it to be
banned as a danger.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">That freethought at the end of the century was
rather driven inwards and downwards than expelled is made clear by the
multitude of fresh treatises on Christian evidences. Growing numerous
after 1790, they positively swarm for a generation after Paley (1794).
Cp. <i>Essays on the Evidence and Influence of Christianity</i>, Bath,
1790, pref.; Andrew Fuller, <i>The Gospel its own Witness</i>, 1799,
pref. and concluding address to deists; Watson&rsquo;s sermon of 1795,
in <i>Two Apologies</i>, ed. 1806, p. 399; Priestley&rsquo;s
<i>Memoirs</i> (written in 1795), 1806, pp. 127&ndash;28;
Wilberforce&rsquo;s <i>Practical View</i>, 1797, <i>passim</i>
(<i>e.g.</i>, pp. 366&ndash;69, 8th ed. 1841); Rev. D. Simpson, <i>A
Plea for Religion ... addressed to the Disciples of Thomas Paine</i>,
1797. The latter writer states (2nd ed. p. 126) that &ldquo;infidelity
is at this moment running like wildfire among the common people&rdquo;;
and Fuller (2nd ed. p. 128) speaks of the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> as
&ldquo;pretty evidently devoted to the cause of infidelity.&rdquo; A
pamphlet on <i>The Rise and Dissolution of the Infidel Societies in
this Metropolis</i> (London, 1800), by W. Hamilton Reid, describes the
period as the first &ldquo;in which the doctrines of infidelity have
been extensively circulated among the lower orders&rdquo;; and a
<i>Summary of Christian Evidences</i>, by Bishop Porteous (1800; 16th
ed. 1826), affirms, in agreement with the 1799 Report of the
Lords&rsquo; Committee on Treasonable Societies, that &ldquo;new
compendiums of infidelity, and new libels on Christianity, are
dispersed continually, with indefatigable industry, through every part
of the kingdom, and every class of the community.&rdquo; Freethought,
in short, was becoming democratized.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">As regards England, Paine is the great popular factor;
and it is the bare truth to say that he brought into the old debate a
new earnestness and a new moral impetus. The first part of the <i>Age
of Reason</i>, hastily put together in expectation of speedy death in
1793, and including some astronomic matter that apparently antedates
1781,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13573src" href="#xd21e13573" name=
"xd21e13573src">242</a> is a swift outline of the position of the
rationalizing deist, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span>newly conscious of firm standing-ground in
astronomic science. That is the special note of Paine&rsquo;s gospel.
He was no scholar; and the champions of the &ldquo;religion of
Galilee&rdquo; have always been prompt to disparage any unlearned
person who meddles with religion as an antagonist; but in the second
part of his book Paine put hard criticism enough to keep a world of
popular readers interested for well over a hundred years. The many
replies are forgotten: the Biblical criticism of Paine will continue to
do its work till popular orthodoxy follows the lead of professional
scholarship and gives up at once the acceptance and the circulation of
things incredible and indefensible as sacrosanct.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Mr. Benn (<i>Hist. of Eng. Rationalism in the
Nineteenth Century</i>, i, 217) remarks that Paine&rsquo;s New
Testament criticisms are &ldquo;such as at all times would naturally
occur to a reader of independent mind and strong common sense.&rdquo;
If so, these had been up to Paine&rsquo;s time, and remained long
afterwards, rare characteristics. And there is some mistake about Mr.
Benn&rsquo;s criticism that &ldquo;the repeated charges of fraud and
imposture brought against the Apostles and Evangelists ... jar
painfully on a modern ear. But they are largely due to the mistaken
notion, shared by Paine with his orthodox contemporaries, that the
Gospels and Acts were written by contemporaries and eye-witnesses of
the events related.&rdquo; Many times over, Paine argues that the
documents could not have been so written. <i>E.g.</i> in Conway&rsquo;s
ed. of Works, pp. 157, 158, 159, 160, 164, 167, 168, etc. The
reiterated proposition is &ldquo;that the writers cannot have been
eye-witnesses and ear-witnesses of what they relate; ... and
consequently that the books have not been written by the persons called
apostles&rdquo; (p. 168). And there is some exaggeration even in Mr.
Benn&rsquo;s remark that, &ldquo;strangely enough, he accepts the Book
of Daniel as genuine.&rdquo; Paine (ed. p. 144) merely puts a balance
of probability in favour of the genuineness. It may be
sometimes&mdash;it is certainly not always&mdash;true that Paine
&ldquo;cannot distinguish between legendary or [? and] mythical
narratives&rdquo; (Benn, p. 216); but it is to be feared that the
disability subsists to-day in more scholarly quarters.</p>
<p class="par">Despite his deadly directness, Paine, in virtue of his
strong sincerity, probably jars much less on the modern ear than he did
on that of his own, which was so ready to make felony of any opinion
hostile to reigning prejudices. But if it be otherwise, it is to be
feared that no less offence will be given by Mr. Benn&rsquo;s own
account of the Hexateuch as &ldquo;the records kept by a lying and
bloodthirsty priesthood&rdquo;; even if that estimate be followed by
the very challengeable admission that &ldquo;priesthoods are generally
distinguished for their superior humanity&rdquo; (Benn, p. 350, and
<i>note</i>).</p>

<p class="par">Henceforth there is a vital difference in the fortunes
of freethought and religion alike. Always in the past the institutional
strength of religion and the social weakness of freethought had lain in
the credulity of the ignorant mass, which had turned to naught an
infinity of rational effort. After the French Revolution, when over a
large area the critical spirit began simultaneously to play on faith
and life, politics and religion, its doubled activity gave it a new
breadth of outlook as of energy, and the slow enlightenment of the mass
opened up a new promise for the ultimate reign of reason. <span class=

&ldquo;Ignorance,&rdquo; Collins writes, &ldquo;is the foundation of
Atheism, and Freethinking the cure of it&rdquo; (<i>Discourse of
Freethinking</i>, p. 105). Like Newton, he contemplated only an
impossible atheism, never formulated by any writer. The
<i>Philosophical Principles of Religion, Natural and
Reveal&rsquo;d</i>, of Dr. George Cheyne (1705, 2nd ed. 1715),
similarly declares (pref. <i>end</i>) that &ldquo;if the modern
[<i>i.e.</i> Newtonian] philosophy demonstrates nothing else, yet it
infallibly proves Atheism to be the most gross ignorance.&rdquo; Thus

There were six separate <i lang="fr">Discourses</i>. Voltaire speaks of
&ldquo;three editions <i lang="fr">coup sur coup</i> of ten thousand
each&rdquo; (<i lang="fr">Lettre sur les auteurs Anglais</i>&mdash;in
<i lang="fr">&OElig;uvres</i>, ed. 1792. lxviii, 359). This seems
extremely unlikely as to any one <i>Discourse</i>; and even 5,000
copies of each <i>Discourse</i> is a hardly credible sale, though the
writer of the sketch of his life (1733) says that &ldquo;the sale of
Mr. Woolston&rsquo;s works was very great.&rdquo; In any case,
Woolston&rsquo;s <i>Discourses</i> are now seldomer met with than
Collins&rsquo;s <i>Discourse of Freethinking</i>. Alberti (<i lang=
"de">Briefe betreffend den Zustand der Religion in
Gross-Brittannien</i>) wrote in 1752 that the <i>Discourses</i> were
even in that day somewhat rare, and seldom found together. Many copies
were probably destroyed by the orthodox, and many would doubtless be
thrown away, as tracts so often are.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Tindal (1653&ndash;1733) was the son of a clergyman, and in 1678 was
elected a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford. From 1685 to 1688 he was a Roman
Catholic. Under William III he wrote three works on points of political
freedom&mdash;one, 1698, on <i>The Liberty of the Press</i>. His
<i>Rights of the Christian Church</i>, anonymously published in 1706, a
defence of Erastianism, made a great sensation, and was
prosecuted&mdash;only to be reprinted. His later <i>Defence of the
Rights of the Christian Church</i> was in 1710, by order of the House
of Commons, burned by the common hangman.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Voltaire commented pointedly on Pope&rsquo;s omission to make any
reference to Shaftesbury, while vending his doctrine. (<i lang=
"fr">Lettres Philosophiques</i>, xxii.) As a matter of fact Pope does
in the <i>Dunciad</i> (iv, 488) refer maliciously to the Theocles of
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <i>Moralists</i> as maintaining a Lucretian theism
or virtual atheism. The explanation is that Shaftesbury had sharply
criticized the political course of Bolingbroke, who in turn ignored him
as a thinker. See the present writer&rsquo;s introd. to
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <i>Characteristics</i>, ed. 1900 (rep. in

Chesterfield in his <i>Characters</i> (app. to the <i>Letters</i>)
testifies that Pope &ldquo;was a deist believing in a future state;
this he has often owned himself to me.&rdquo; (Bradshaw&rsquo;s ed. of
<i>Letters</i>, iii, 1410.) Chesterfield makes a similar statement
concerning Queen Caroline:&mdash;&ldquo;After puzzling herself in all
the whimsies and fantastical speculations of different sects, she fixed
herself ultimately in Deism, believing in a future state.&rdquo;

objections so weak &ldquo;as that they deserve not a hearing but rather

Complaint to this effect was made by orthodox writers. The Scotch
Professor Halyburton, for instance, complains that in many sermons in
his day &ldquo;<i>Heathen Morality</i> has been substituted in the room
of <i>Gospel Holiness</i>. And Ethicks by some have been preached
instead of the <i>Gospels</i> of Christ.&rdquo; <i>Natural Religion
Insufficient</i> (Edinburgh), 1714, p. 25. Cp. pp. 23, 26&ndash;27, 59,
etc. Bishop Burnet, in the Conclusion to his <i>History of his Own
Time</i>, declares, &ldquo;I must own that the main body of our clergy
has always seemed dead and lifeless to me,&rdquo; and ascribes much
more zeal to Catholics and dissenters. (Ed. 1838, pp.

Sir Leslie Stephen, i, 158&ndash;63. It is noteworthy, however, that in
his <i>Spirit of Prayer</i> (1750), pt. ii, dial. i, Law expressly
argues that &ldquo;No other religion can be right but that which has
its foundation in Nature. For the God of Nature can require nothing of
his creatures but what the state of their nature calls them to.&rdquo;

(Sinclair&rsquo;s <i>Life of Sir John Sinclair</i>, i, 40) that he
thought the passage &ldquo;unnecessary and misplaced.&rdquo; But this

Smith&rsquo;s admiration for Voltaire might alone indicate his mental
attitude. As to that see F. W. Hirst, <i>Adam Smith</i> (Eng. Men of
Letters ser.), pp. 127&ndash;28. But the assertion of Skarzinski, that
Smith, after being an Idealist under the influence of <i>Hume</i>,
&ldquo;returned a materialist&rdquo; from his intercourse with Voltaire
and other French freethinkers, is an exhibition of learned ignorance.

convincing. Synge, after becoming Archbishop of Tuam, continued to
publish his propagandist tracts, among them <i>An Essay towards making
the Knowledge of Religion Easy to the Meanest Capacity</i> (6th ed.
1734), which is quite orthodox, and which argues (p. 3) that the
doctrine of the Trinity is to be believed, and not pried into,
&ldquo;because it is above our understanding to comprehend.&rdquo; All
the while there was being sold also his early treatise, &ldquo;<i>A
Gentleman&rsquo;s Religion: in Three Parts</i> ... with an Appendix,
wherein it is proved that nothing contrary to our Reason can possibly
be the object of our belief, but that it is no just exception against

that is told of this prelate by Lecky (<i>Hist. of Ireland in the 18th
Cent.</i> 1892. i, 207) is that at Killala he patronized horse-races.
He was industrious on more episcopal lines. He wrote an <i>Introduction
to the History of the Jews</i>; a <i>Vindication of Biblical
Chronology</i>; two treatises on prophecy; an anti-Athanasian <i>Essay
on Spirit</i> (1751), which aroused much controversy; <i>A Vindication
of the Histories of the Old and New Testament</i>, in answer to
Bolingbroke (2 vols. 1752&ndash;1754; 2nd ed. 1757; rep. with the
<i>Essay on Spirit</i>, Dublin, 1759), which led to his being
prosecuted; and other works. The offence given by the
<i>Vindication</i> lay in his denunciation of the Athanasian creed, and
of the bigotry of those who supported it. See pt. iii, letters i and
ii. The <i>Essay on Spirit</i> is no less heterodox. In other respects,

Lecky, writing in 1865, and advancing on Burke, has said of the whole
school, including Shaftesbury, that &ldquo;the shadow of the tomb rests
on all: a deep, unbroken silence, the chill of death, surrounds them.
They have long ceased to wake any interest&rdquo; (<i>Rationalism in
Europe</i>, i, 116). As a matter of fact, they had been discussed by
Taylor in 1853; by Pattison in 1860; and by Farrar in 1862; and they
have since been discussed at length by Dr. Hunt, by Dr. Cairns, by
Lange, by Gyzicki, by M. Sayous, by Sir Leslie Stephen, by Prof.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch17.1" class="par first">1. The fruits of the intellectual
movement of the seventeenth century are seen beginning to take form on
the very threshold of the eighteenth. In 1700, at the height of the
reign of the King&rsquo;s confessors, there was privately printed the
<i lang="fr">Lettre d&rsquo;Hippocrate &agrave; Damag&egrave;te</i>,
described as &ldquo;the first French work openly destructive of
Christianity.&rdquo; It was ascribed to the Comte de Boulainvilliers, a
pillar of the feudal system.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13612src" href=
"#xd21e13612" name="xd21e13612src">1</a> Thus early is the sound of
disintegration heard in the composite fabric of Church and State; and
various fissures are seen in all parts of the structure. The king
himself, so long morally discredited, could only discredit pietism by
his adoption of it; the Jansenists and the Molinists [<i>i.e.</i>, the
school of Molina, not of Molinos] fought incessantly; even on the side
of authority there was bitter dissension between Bossuet and
F&eacute;nelon;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13630src" href="#xd21e13630"
name="xd21e13630src">2</a> and the movement of mysticism associated
with the latter came to nothing, though he had the rare credit of
converting, albeit to a doubtful orthodoxy, the emotional young Scotch
deist Chevalier Ramsay.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13636src" href=
"#xd21e13636" name="xd21e13636src">3</a> Where the subtlety of
F&eacute;nelon was not allowed to operate, the loud dialectic of
Bossuet could not avail for faith as against rationalism, whatever it
might do to upset the imperfect logic of Protestant sects. In no
society, indeed, does mere declamation play a larger part than in that
of modern France; but in no society, on the other hand, is mere
declamation more sure to be disdained and derided by the keener
spirits. In the years of disaster and decadence which rounded off in
gloom the life of the Grand Monarque, with defeat dogging his armies
and bankruptcy threatening his finances, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>spirit of criticism was not likely to slacken.
Literary polemic, indeed, was hardly to be thought of at such a time,
even if it had been safe. In 1709 the king destroyed the Jansenist
seminary of Port Royal, wreaking an ignoble vengeance on the very bones
of the dead there buried; and more heretical thinkers had need go
warily.</p>
<p class="par">Yet even in those years of calamity, perhaps by reason
of the very stress of it, some freethinking books somehow passed the
press, though a system of police espionage had been built up by the
king, step for step with some real reforms in the municipal government
of Paris. The first was a romance of the favourite type, in which a
traveller discovers a strange land inhabited by surprisingly rational
people. Such appear to have been the <i lang="fr">Histoire de
Calejava</i>, by Claude Gilbert, produced at Dijon in 1700, and the
imaginary travels of Juan de Posos, published at Amsterdam in 1708.
Both of these were promptly suppressed; the next contrived to get into
circulation. The work of Symon Tyssot de Patot, <i lang="fr">Voyages et
Avantures de Jacques Mass&eacute;</i>, published in 1710, puts in the
mouths of priests of the imaginary land discovered by the traveller
such mordant arguments against the idea of a resurrection, the story of
the fall, and other items of the Christian creed, that there could be
small question of the deism of the author;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13659src" href="#xd21e13659" name="xd21e13659src">4</a> and the
prefatory <i lang="fr">Lettre de l&rsquo;&eacute;diteur</i> indicates
misgivings. The <i lang="fr">R&eacute;flexions sur les grands hommes
qui sont morts en plaisantant</i>, by Deslandes, ostensibly published
at Amsterdam in 1712, seems to have had a precarious circulation,
inasmuch as Brunet never saw the first edition. To permit of the issue
of such a book as <i>Jacques Mass&eacute;</i>&mdash;even at
Bordeaux&mdash;the censure must have been notably lax; as it was again
in the year of the king&rsquo;s death, when there appeared a
translation of Collins&rsquo;s <i>Discourse of Freethinking</i>. For
the moment the Government was occupied over an insensate renewal of the
old persecution of Protestants, promulgating in 1715 a decree that all
who died after refusing the sacraments should be refused burial, and
that their goods should be confiscated. The edict seems to have been in
large measure disregarded.</p>
<p id="ch17.2" class="par">2. At the same time the continuous output of
apologetics testified to the gathering tide of unbelief. The
Benedictine Lami followed up his attack on Spinoza with a more popular
treatise, <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Incr&eacute;dule amen&eacute; &agrave;
la religion par la raison</i> (1710); the Abb&eacute; Genest turned
Descartes into verse by way of <i lang="fr">Preuves naturelles de
l&rsquo;existence de <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215"
name="pb215">215</a>]</span>Dieu et de l&rsquo;immortalit&eacute; de
l&rsquo;&acirc;me</i> (1716); and the <i>Anti-Lucretius</i> of Cardinal
Polignac (1661&ndash;1741), though only posthumously published in full
(1745), did but pass on to the next age, when deism was the prevailing
heresy, a deistic argument against atheism. It is difficult to see any
Christian sentiment in that dialectic performance of a born
diplomatist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13697src" href="#xd21e13697"
name="xd21e13697src">5</a></p>
<p class="par">When the old king died, even the fashion of conformity
passed away among the upper classes;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13711src" href="#xd21e13711" name="xd21e13711src">6</a> and the
feverish manufacture of apologetic works testifies to an unslackened
activity of unbelief. In 1719 Jean Denyse, professor of philosophy at
the college of Montaigu, produced <i lang="fr">La v&eacute;rit&eacute;
de la religion chr&eacute;tienne demontr&eacute;e par ordre
g&eacute;om&eacute;trique</i> (a title apparently suggested by
Spinoza&rsquo;s early exposition of Descartes), without making any
permanent impression on heterodox opinion. Not more successful,
apparently, was the performance of the Abb&eacute; Houteville, first
published in 1722.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13726src" href=
"#xd21e13726" name="xd21e13726src">7</a> Much more amiable in tone, and
more scientific in temper, than the common run of defences, it was
found, says an orthodox biographical dictionary, to be &ldquo;better
fitted to make unbelievers than to convert them,&rdquo; seeing that
&ldquo;objections were presented with much force and fulness, and the
replies with more amenity than weight.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13731src" href="#xd21e13731" name="xd21e13731src">8</a> That the
Abb&eacute; was in fact not rigorously orthodox might almost be
suspected from his having been appointed, in the last year of his life
(1742), &ldquo;perpetual secretary&rdquo; to the Acad&eacute;mie, an
office which somehow tended to fall to more or less freethinking
members, being held before him by the Abb&eacute; Dubos, and after him
by Mirabaud, the Abb&eacute; Duclos,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13739src" href="#xd21e13739" name="xd21e13739src">9</a>
D&rsquo;Alembert, and Marmontel. The <i lang="fr">Trait&eacute;s des
Premi&egrave;res Verit&eacute;z</i> of the Jesuit Father Buffier (1724)
can hardly have been more helpful to the faith.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13752src" href="#xd21e13752" name="xd21e13752src">10</a> Another
experiment by way of popularizing orthodoxy, the copious <i lang=
"fr">Histoire du peuple de Dieu</i>, by the Jesuit Berruyer, first
published in 1728,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13758src" href=
"#xd21e13758" name="xd21e13758src">11</a> had little better fortune,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>inasmuch as it scandalized the orthodox by its
secularity of tone without persuading the freethinkers. Condemned by
the Bishop of Montpellier in 1731, it was censured by Rome in 1734; and
the second part, produced long afterwards, aroused even more
antagonism.</p>
<p id="ch17.3" class="par">3. There was thus no adaptation on the side
of the Church to the forces which in an increasing degree menaced her
rule. Under the regency of Orl&eacute;ans (1715&ndash;1723), the open
disorder of the court on the one hand and the ruin of the disastrous
financial experiment of Law on the other were at least favourable to
toleration; but under the Duc de Bourbon, put in power and soon
superseded by Fleury (bishop of Fr&eacute;jus and tutor of Louis XV;
later cardinal) there was a renewal of the rigours against the
Protestants and the Jansenists; the edict of 1715 was renewed;
emigration recommenced; and only public outcry checked the policy of
persecution on that side. But Fleury and the king went on fighting the
Jansenists; and while this embittered strife of the religious sections
could not but favour the growth of freethought, it was incompatible
alike with official tolerance of unbelief and with any effectual
diffusion of liberal culture. Had the terrorism and the waste of Louis
XIV been followed by a sane system of finance and one of religious
toleration; and had not the exhausted and bankrupt country been kept
for another half century&mdash;save for eight years of peace and
prosperity from 1748 to 1755&mdash;on the rack of ruinous wars, alike
under the regency of Orl&eacute;ans and the rule of Louis XV, the
intellectual life might have gone fast and far. As it was, war after
war absorbed its energy; and the debt of five milliards left by Louis
XIV was never seriously lightened. Under such a system the vestiges of
constitutional government were gradually swept away.</p>
<p id="ch17.4" class="par">4. As the new intellectual movement began to
find expression, then, it found the forces of resistance more and more
organized. In particular, the autocracy long maintained the severest
checks on printing, so that freethought could not save by a rare chance
attain to open speech. Any book with the least tendency to rationalism
had to seek printers, or at least publishers, in Holland. Huard, in
publishing his anonymous translation of the <i>Hypotyposes</i> of
Sextus Empiricus (1725), is careful to say in his preface that he
&ldquo;makes no application of the Pyrrhonian objections to any dogma
that may be called theological&rdquo;; but he goes on to add that the
scandalous quarrels of Christian sects are well fitted to confirm
Pyrrhonists in their doubts, the sects having no solid ground on which
to condemn each other. As such an assertion was rank heresy, the
translation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>had to be issued in Amsterdam, and even there
without a publisher&rsquo;s name.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13772src"
href="#xd21e13772" name="xd21e13772src">12</a> And still it remains
clear that the age of Louis XIV had passed on to the next a heritage of
hidden freethinking, as well as one of debt and misgovernment. What
takes place thereafter is rather an evolution of and a clerical
resistance to a growth known to have begun previously, and always
feared and hated, than any new planting of unbelief in orthodox soil.
As we have seen, indeed, a part of the early work of skepticism was
done by distinguished apologists. Huet, dying in 1722, left for
posthumous publication his <i lang="fr">Trait&eacute; philosophique de
la faiblesse de l&rsquo;esprit humain</i> (1723). It was immediately
translated into English and German; and though it was probably found
somewhat superfluous in deistic England, and supersubtle in Lutheran
Germany, it helped to prepare the ground for the active unbelief of the
next generation in France.</p>
<p id="ch17.5" class="par">5. A continuous development may be traced
throughout the century. <span class="sc">Montesquieu</span>, who in his

little book on the <i>Greatness and Decadence of the Romans</i> (1734)
and his famous <i>Spirit of Laws</i> (1748) to treat the problems of
human history in an absolutely secular and scientific spirit, making
only such conventional allusions to religion as were advisable in an
age in which all heretical works were suppressible.<a class="noteref"

much doubt about Montesquieu&rsquo;s deism. In his posthumous <i lang=
"fr">Pens&eacute;es</i> his anti-clericalism is sufficiently emphatic.
&ldquo;Churchmen,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;are interested in keeping
the people ignorant.&rdquo; He expresses himself as a convinced deist,
and, with no great air of conviction, as a believer in immortality. But
there his faith ends. &ldquo;I call piety,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;a
malady of the heart, which plants in the soul a malady of the most
ineradicable kind.&rdquo; &ldquo;The false notion of miracles comes of
our vanity, which makes us believe we are important enough for the
Supreme Being to upset Nature on our behalf.&rdquo; &ldquo;Three
incredibilities among incredibilities: the pure mechanism of animals

divined by the guardians of the faith, through all his panegyric of it.
Even in his lifetime, Jesuits and Jansenists combined to attack the
<i>Spirit of Laws</i>, which was denounced at an assembly of the
clergy, put on the Roman Index, and prohibited by the censure until
Malesherbes came into office in 1750.<a class="noteref" id=

the political rationalism and the ethical utilitarianism of Cumberland
and Grotius were alike repelled as irreconcilable with the doctrine of
revelation. It was doubtless because of this atmosphere of hostility
that on the death of Montesquieu at Paris, in 1755, Diderot was the
only man of letters who attended his funeral,<a class="noteref" id=

life a figure in &ldquo;good society,&rdquo; and suffered no

tradition of private freethinking and public clericalism, even as did
Moli&egrave;re in the previous century; and where the two traditions
had to clash, as at interment, the clerical dominion affirmed itself.
But even in the Church there were always successors of Gassendi, to
wit, philosophic unbelievers, as well as quiet friends of toleration.
And it was given to an obscure Churchman to show the way of freethought

<p id="ch17.6" class="par">6. One of the most comprehensive
freethinking works of the century, the <i>Testament</i> of <span class=

(d. 1723, 1729, or 1733), though it inspired numbers of

notice.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13909src" href="#xd21e13909" name=

two autograph copies of his book, after having deposited a third copy
in the archives of the jurisdiction of Sainte-Menehould. By a strange
chance one was permitted to circulate, and ultimately there were some
hundred copies in Paris, selling at ten louis apiece. As he told on the
wrapper of the copy he left for his parishioners, he had not dared to
speak out during his life; but he had made full amends. He is recorded
to have been an exceptionally charitable priest, devoted to his
parishioners, whose interests he indignantly championed against a
tyrannous lord of the manor;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13915src" href=
"#xd21e13915" name="xd21e13915src">26</a> apropos of Descartes&rsquo;s
doctrine of animal automatism, which he fiercely repudiates, he
denounces with deep feeling all cruelty to animals, at whose slaughter
for food he winces; and his book reveals him as a man profoundly
impressed at once by the sufferings of the people under heartless kings
and nobles, and the immense imposture of religion which, in his eyes,
maintained the whole evil system. Some men before him had impugned
miracles, some the gospels, some dogma, some the conception of deity,
some the tyranny of kings. He impugns all; and where nearly all the
deists had eulogized the character of the Gospel Jesus, the priest
envelops it in his harshest invective.</p>
<p class="par">He must have written during whole years, with a sombre,
invincible patience, dumbly building up, in his lonely leisure, his
unfaltering negation of all that the men around him held for sacred,
and that he was sworn to preach&mdash;the whole to be his testament to
his parishioners. In the slow, heavy style&mdash;the style of a cart
horse, Voltaire called it&mdash;there is an indubitable sincerity, a
smouldering passion, but no haste, no explosion. The long-drawn,
formless, prolix sentences say everything that can be said on their
theme; and when the long book was done it was slowly copied, and yet
again copied, by the same heavy, unwearying hand. He had read few
books, it seems&mdash;only the Bible, some of the Fathers, Montaigne,
the &ldquo;Turkish Spy,&rdquo; Naud&eacute;, Charron, Pliny,
Tourn&eacute;mine on atheism, and F&eacute;nelon on the existence of
God, with some history, and Moreri&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>Dictionary; but he had re-read them often. He
does not cite Bayle; and Montaigne is evidently his chief master. But
on his modest reading he had reached as absolute a conviction of the
untruth of the entire Jud&aelig;o-Christian religion as any freethinker
ever had. Moved above all by his sense of the corruption and misrule
around him, he sets out with a twofold indictment against religion and
government, of which each part sustains the other, and he tells his
parishioners how he had been &ldquo;hundreds of times&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13928src" href="#xd21e13928" name=
"xd21e13928src">27</a> on the point of bursting out with an indignant
avowal of his contempt for the rites he was compelled to administer,
and the superstitions he had to inculcate. Then, in a grimly-planned
order, he proceeds to demolish, section by section, the whole
structure.</p>
<p class="par">Religions in general he exhibits as tissues of error,
illusion, and imposture, the endless sources of troubles and strifes
for men. Their historical proofs and documentary bases are then
assailed, and the gospels in particular are ground between the slow
mill-stones of his dialectic; miracles, promises, and prophecies being
handled in turn. The ethic and the doctrine are next assailed all along
the line, from their theoretic bases to their political results; and
the kings of France fare no better than their creed. As against the
theistic argument of F&eacute;nelon, the entire theistic system is then
oppugned, sometimes with precarious erudition, generally with cumbrous
but solid reasoning; and the eternity of matter is affirmed with more
than Averro&iuml;stic conviction, the Cartesians coming in for a long
series of heavy blows. Immortality is further denied, as miracles had
been; and the treatise ends with a stern affirmation of its
author&rsquo;s rectitude, and, as it were, a massive gesture of
contempt for all that will be said against him when he has passed into
the nothingness which he is nearing. &ldquo;I have never committed any
crime,&rdquo; he writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13936src" href=
"#xd21e13936" name="xd21e13936src">28</a> &ldquo;nor any bad or
malicious action: I defy any man to make me on this head, with justice,
any serious reproach&rdquo;; but he quotes from the Psalms, with grim
zest, phrases of hate towards workers of iniquity. There is not even
the hint of a smile at the astonishing bequest he was laying up for his
parishioners and his country. He was sure he would be read, and he was
right. The whole polemic of the next sixty years, the indictment of the
government no less than that of the creed, is laid out in his sombre
treatise.</p>
<p class="par">To the general public, however, he was never known save
by the &ldquo;Extract&rdquo;&mdash;really a deistic
adaptation&mdash;made by Voltaire,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13941src"

old priest&rsquo;s legacy.</p>
<p id="ch17.7" class="par">7. Apart from this direct influence, too,
others of the cloth bore some part in the general process of
enlightenment. A good type of the agnostic priest of the period was the
Abb&eacute; Terrasson, the author of the philosophic romance
<i>Sethos</i> (1732), who died in 1750. Not very judicious in his
theory of human evolution (which he represented as a continuous growth
from a stage of literary infancy, seen in Homer), he adopted the
Newtonian theory at a time when the entire Academy stood by
Cartesianism. Among his friends he tranquilly avowed his
atheism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13968src" href="#xd21e13968" name=
"xd21e13968src">31</a> He died &ldquo;without the sacraments,&rdquo;

anti-clerical Abb&eacute; was Gaidi, whose poem, <i lang="fr">La

<p class="par">Among or alongside of such disillusioned Churchmen there
must have been a certain number who, desiring no breach with the
organization to which they belonged, saw the fatal tendency of the
spirit of persecution upon which its rulers always fell back in their
struggle with freethought, and sought to open their eyes to the folly
and futility of their course. Freethinkers, of course, had to lead the
way, as we have seen. It was the young Turgot who in 1753 published two
powerful <i lang="fr">Lettres sur la tol&eacute;rance</i>, and in 1754
a further series of admirable <i lang="fr">Lettres d&rsquo;un
eccl&eacute;siastique &agrave; un magistrat</i>, pleading the same
cause.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13997src" href="#xd21e13997" name=
"xd21e13997src">34</a> But similar appeals were anonymously made, by a
clerical pen, at a moment when the Church was about to enter on a new
and exasperating conflict with the growing band of freethinking writers
who rallied round Voltaire. The small book of <i lang="fr">Questions
sur la tol&eacute;rance</i>, ascribed to the Abb&eacute; Tailh&eacute;
or Tailhi&eacute; and the canonist Maultrot (Geneva, 1758), is
conceived in the very spirit of rationalism, yet with a careful concern
to persuade the clergy to sane courses, and is to this day worth
reading as a utilitarian argument. But the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>Church was not fated to be led by such light.
The principle of toleration was left to become the watchword of
freethought, while the Church identified herself collectively with that
of tyranny.</p>
<p class="par">Anecdotes of the time reveal the coincidence of tyranny
and evasion, intolerance and defiance. Of Nicolas Boindin
(1676&ndash;1751), procureur in the royal Bureau des Finances, who was
received into the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres in 1706,
it is told that he &ldquo;would have been received in the French
Academy if the public profession he made of being an atheist had not
excluded him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14010src" href=
"#xd21e14010" name="xd21e14010src">35</a> But the publicity was
guarded. When he conversed with the young Marmontel<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e14015src" href="#xd21e14015" name="xd21e14015src">36</a> and
others at the Caf&eacute; Procope, they used a conversational code in
which the soul was called <i lang="fr">Margot</i>, religion <i lang=
"fr">Javotte</i>, liberty <i lang="fr">Jeanneton</i>, and the deity
<i lang="fr">Monsieur de l&rsquo;&Ecirc;tre</i>. Once a listener of
furtive aspect asked Boindin who might be this <span lang="fr">Monsieur
de l&rsquo;&Ecirc;tre</span> who behaved so ill, and with whom they
were so displeased? &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Boindin, &ldquo;he
is a police spy&rdquo;&mdash;such being the avocation of the
questioner.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14037src" href="#xd21e14037"
name="xd21e14037src">37</a> &ldquo;The morals of Boindin,&rdquo; says a
biographical dictionary of the period, &ldquo;were as pure as those of
an atheist can be; his heart was generous; but to these virtues he
joined presumption and the obstinacy which follows from it, a
<i>bizarre</i> humour, and an unsociable character.&rdquo;<a class=

<p id="ch17.8" class="par">8. With the ground prepared as we have seen,
freethought was bound to progress in France in the age of Louis XV; but
it chanced that the lead fell into the hands of the most brilliant and
fecund of all the writers of the century. <span class=

work. It is on record that many of his school-fellows were, like
himself, already deists, though his brother, a juvenile Jansenist, made
vows to propitiate the deity on the small unbeliever&rsquo;s
behalf.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14082src" href="#xd21e14082" name=
"xd21e14082src">42</a> It may have been a general reputation for
audacious thinking that led to his being charged with the authorship of
a stinging philippic published in 1715, after the death of Louis XIV.
The unknown author, a young man, enumerated the manifold abuses and
iniquities of the reign, concluding: &ldquo;I have seen all these, and
I am not twenty years old.&rdquo; Voltaire was then twenty-two; but
D&rsquo;Argenson, who in the poem had been called &ldquo;the enemy of
the human race,&rdquo; finding no likelier author for the verses, put
him under surveillance and exiled him from Paris; and on his imprudent
return imprisoned him for nearly a year in the Bastille (1716),
releasing him only when the real author of the verses avowed himself.
Unconquerable then as always, Voltaire devoted himself in prison to his
literary ambitions, planning his <i lang="fr">Henriade</i> and
completing his <i lang="fr">&OElig;dipe</i>, which was produced in 1718
with signal success.</p>
<p class="par">Voltaire was thus already a distinguished young poet and
dramatist when, in 1726, after enduring the affronts of an assault by a
nobleman&rsquo;s lacqueys, and of imprisonment in the Bastille for
seeking amends by duel, he came to England, where, like Deslandes
before him, he met with a ready welcome from the freethinkers.<a class=

conviction in a vehement impeachment of the immoral creed of salvation
and damnation, making the declaration, &ldquo;I am not a
Christian.&rdquo; Thus what he had to learn in England was not deism,
but the physics of Newton and the details of the deist campaign against
revelationism; and these he mastered.<a class="noteref" id=

the day,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14147src" href="#xd21e14147" name=

<i lang="fr">Pour et Contre</i>, his first freethinking production was
the not very heretical <i lang="fr">Lettres philosophiques</i> or
<i lang="fr">Lettres anglaises</i>, written in England in 1728, and,
after circulating in MS., published in five editions in 1734; and the
official burning of the book by the common hangman, followed by the
imprisonment of the bookseller in the Bastille,<a class="noteref" id=

sufficient check on such activity for the time. Save for the jests
about Adam and Eve in the <i lang="fr">Mondain</i> (1736), a slight
satire for which he had to fly from Paris; and the indirect though
effective thrusts at bigotry in the <i lang="fr">Ligue</i> (1723; later
the <i lang="fr">Henriade</i>); in the tragedy of <i lang=

de La Mothe le Vayer</i> (1751) and the <i lang="fr">D&eacute;fense de

deistic till 1755, when he published the &ldquo;Poem to the King of
Prussia,&rdquo; otherwise named <i lang="fr">Sur la loi naturelle</i>
(which appears to have been written in 1751, while he was on a visit to
the Margravine of Bayreuth), and that on the Earthquake of Lisbon. So
definitely did the former poem base all morality on natural principles
that it was ordered to be burned by the Parlement of Paris, then
equally alarmed at freethinking and at Molinism.<a class="noteref" id=

impossible was it still in France to print any specific criticism of
Christianity that when in 1759 he issued his verse translations of the

<p id="ch17.9" class="par">9. It is thus a complete mistake on the part
of Buckle to affirm that the activity of the French reformers up to
1750 was directed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225"
name="pb225">225</a>]</span>against religion, and that it was
thereafter turned against the State. Certainly there was much
freethinking among instructed men and others, but it proceeded, as
under Louis XIV, mainly by way of manuscripts and conversation, or at
best by the circulation of English books and a few translations of
these; and only guardedly before 1745 by means of published French
books.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14225src" href="#xd21e14225" name=
"xd21e14225src">51</a> The Abb&eacute; Ranchon, in his MS. Life of
Cardinal Fleury, truly says that &ldquo;the time of the Regency was a
period of the spirit of dissoluteness and irreligion&rdquo;; but when
he ascribes to &ldquo;those times&rdquo; many &ldquo;licentious and
destructive writings&rdquo; he can specify only those of the English
deists. &ldquo;Precisely in the time of the Regency a multitude of
those offensive and irreligious books were brought over the sea: France
was deluged with them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14228src"
href="#xd21e14228" name="xd21e14228src">52</a> It is incredible that
multitudes of Frenchmen read English in the days of the Regency. French
freethinkers like Saint Evremond and Deslandes, who visited or
sojourned in London before 1715, took their freethought there with
them; and the only translations then in print were those of
Collins&rsquo;s <i>Discourse of Freethinking</i> and
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s essays on the Use of Ridicule and on Enthusiasm.
Apart from these, the only known French freethinking book of the
Regency period was the work of Vroes, a councillor at the court of
Brabant, on the <i>Spirit of Spinoza</i>, reprinted as <i lang="fr">Des
trois imposteurs</i>. Meslier died not earlier than 1729; the <i lang=
"fr">Histoire de la philosophie payenne</i> of Burigny belongs to 1724;
the <i lang="fr">Lettres philosophiques</i> of Voltaire to 1734; the
earlier works of d&rsquo;Argens to 1737&ndash;38; the <i lang=
"fr">Nouvelles libert&eacute;s de penser</i>, edited by Dumarsais, to
1743; and the militant treatise of De la Serre, best known as the
<i lang="fr">Examen de la Religion</i>, to 1745.</p>
<p class="par">The ferment thus kept up was indeed so great that about
1748 the ecclesiastical authorities decided on the remarkable step of
adopting for their purposes the apologetic treatise adapted by Jacob
Vernet, professor of <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i> at Geneva, from
the works of Jean-Alphonse Turrettin,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14261src" href="#xd21e14261" name="xd21e14261src">53</a> not only
a Protestant but a substantially Socinian professor of ecclesiastical
history at the same university. The treatise is itself a testimony to
the advance of rationalism in the Protestant world; and its adoption,
even under correction, by the Catholic Church in France tells of a keen
consciousness of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226"
name="pb226">226</a>]</span>need. But the dreaded advance, as we have
seen, was only to a small extent yet traceable by new literature. The
<i lang="fr">Examen critique des apologistes de la religion
chr&eacute;tienne</i> of L&eacute;vesque de Burigny was probably
written about 1732, and then and thereafter circulated in manuscript,
but it was not published till 1766; and even in manuscript its
circulation was probably small, though various apologetic works had
testified to the increasing uneasiness of the orthodox world. Such
titles as <i lang="fr">La religion chr&eacute;tienne demontr&eacute;e
par la Resurrection</i> (by Armand de la Chapelle, 1728) and <i lang=
"fr">La religion chr&eacute;tienne prouv&eacute;e par
l&rsquo;accomplissement des proph&eacute;ties</i> (by P&egrave;re
Baltus, 1728) tell of private unbelief under the Regency. In 1737
appeared the voluminous treatise (anonymous) of the Abb&eacute; de la
Chambre, <i lang="fr">Trait&eacute; de la v&eacute;ritable religion
contre les ath&eacute;es, les d&eacute;istes, etc.</i> (5 vols.). In
1747, again, there appeared a learned, laborious, and unintelligent
work in three volumes (authorized in 1742), <i lang="fr">Le Libertinage
combattu par la t&eacute;moignage des auteurs profanes</i>, by an
unnamed Benedictine<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14288src" href=

Vanne. It declares that, between atheism and deism, there has never
been so much unbelief as now; but it cites no modern books, and is
devoted to arraying classic arguments in support of theism and morals.
Part of the exposition consists in showing that Epicurus, Lucian, and
Euripides, whom modern atheists are wont to cite as their masters, were
not and could not have been atheists; and the pious author roundly
declares in favour of paganism as against atheism.</p>
<p class="par">So much smoke tells of fire; but only in 1745 and 1746
did the printed <i lang="fr">Examen</i> of De la Serre and the <i lang=

France the modern school of critical and philosophic deism. When in
1751 the Abb&eacute; Gauchat began his series of <i lang="fr">Lettres

Man</i>; taking up in his second volume the <i lang="fr">Lettres
Persanes</i> of Montesquieu (1721), and other sets of <i lang=

has nothing more aggressive of Voltaire&rsquo;s to deal with than
<i lang="fr">La Henriade</i>, the <i lang="fr">Mahomet</i>, and some of
his fugitive pieces. And the Bishop of Puy, writing in 1754 his
<i lang="fr">La D&eacute;votion concili&eacute;e avec
l&rsquo;esprit</i>, could say to the faithful: &ldquo;You live in an
age fertile in pretended <i lang="fr">esprits forts</i>, who, too weak
nevertheless to attack in front an invincible religion, skirmish
lightly around it, and in default of the reasons they lack,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=

chivalrous bishop knew perfectly well that had a serious attack been
published author and publisher would have been sent if possible to the

<p class="par">Buckle has probably mistaken the meaning of the summing
up of some previous writer to the effect that up to 1750 or a few years
later the political opposition to the Court was religious, in the sense
of ecclesiastical or sectarian (Jansenist),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14359src" href="#xd21e14359" name="xd21e14359src">58</a> and that

"xd21e14368src">59</a> It would be truer to say that the early <i lang=
"fr">Lettres philosophiques</i>, the reading of which later made the
boy Lafayette a republican at nine, were a polemic for political and
social freedom, and as such a more direct criticism of the French
administrative system than Voltaire ever penned afterwards, save in the
<i lang="fr">Voix du Sage et du Peuple</i> (1750). In point of fact, as
will be shown below, only some twenty scattered freethinking works had
appeared in French up to 1745, almost none of them directly attacking
Christian beliefs; and, despite the above-noted sallies of Voltaire,
Condorcet comes to the general conclusion that it was the hardihood of
Rousseau&rsquo;s deism in the &ldquo;Confession of a Savoyard
Vicar&rdquo; in his <i lang="fr">&Eacute;mile</i> (1762) that spurred
Voltaire to new activity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14390src" href=
"#xd21e14390" name="xd21e14390src">60</a> This is perhaps not quite
certain; there is some reason to believe that his &ldquo;Sermon of the

Christianity,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14396src" href=
"#xd21e14396" name="xd21e14396src">61</a> was written a year before;
but in any case that and other productions of his at once left Rousseau
far in the rear. Even now he had no fixed purpose of continuous warfare
against so powerful and cruel an enemy as the Church, which in 1757 had
actually procured an edict pronouncing the death penalty against all
writers of works attacking religion; though the fall of the Jesuits in
1764 raised new hopes of freedom. But when, after that hopeful episode,
there began a new movement of Jansenist fanaticism; and when, after the
age of religious savagery had seemed to be over, there began a new
series of religious atrocities in France <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>itself
(1762&ndash;66), he girded on a sword that was not to be laid down till
his death.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Even so late as 1768, in his last letter to
Damilaville (8 f&eacute;v.), Voltaire expresses a revulsion against the
aggressive freethought propaganda of the time which is either one of
his epistolary stratagems or the expression of a nervous reaction in a
time of protracted bad health. &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Mes chagrins
redoublent,</span>&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">par la
quantit&eacute; incroyable d&rsquo;&eacute;crits contre la religion
chr&eacute;tienne, qui se succ&eacute;dent aussi rapidement en Hollande
que les gazettes et les journaux.</span>&rdquo; His enemies have the
barbarism to impute to him, at his age, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">une
partie de ces extravagances compos&eacute;es par de jeunes gens et par
des moines d&eacute;froqu&eacute;s.</span>&rdquo; His immediate ground
for chagrin may have been the fact that this outbreak of anti-Christian
literature was likely to thwart him in the campaign he was then making
to secure justice to the Sirven family as he had already vindicated
that of Calas. Sirven barely missed the fate of the latter.</p>
<p class="par">The misconception of Buckle, above discussed, has been
widely shared even among students. Thus Lord Morley, discussing the
&ldquo;Creed of the Savoyard Vicar&rdquo; in Rousseau&rsquo;s <i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;mile</i> (1762), writes that &ldquo;Souls weary of the
fierce mockeries that had so long been flying like fiery shafts against
the far Jehovah of the Hebrews, and the silent Christ of the later
doctors and dignitaries,&rdquo; may well have turned to it with ardour
(<i>Rousseau</i>, ed. 1886, ii, 266). He further speaks of the
&ldquo;superiority of the sceptical parts of the Savoyard Vicar&rsquo;s
profession ... over the biting mockeries which Voltaire had made the
fashionable method of assault&rdquo; (p. 294). No specifications are
offered, and the chronology is seen to be astray. The only mockeries
which Voltaire could be said to have made fashionable before 1760 were
those of his <i lang="fr">Lettres philosophiques</i>, his
<i>Mondain</i>, his <i lang="fr">D&eacute;fense de Milord
Bolingbroke</i>, and his philosophically humorous tales, as
<i>Candide</i>, <i>Zadig</i>, <i>Microm&eacute;gas</i>, etc.: all his
distinctive attacks on Judaism and Christianity were yet to come. [The
Abb&eacute; Guyon, in his <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Oracle des nouveaux
philosophes</i> (Berne, 1759&ndash;60, 2 tom.), proclaims an attack on
doctrines taught &ldquo;<span lang="fr">dans les livres de nos beaux
esprits</span>&rdquo; (<i>Avert.</i> p. xi); but he specifies only
denials of (1) revelation, (2) immortality, and (3) the Biblical
account of man&rsquo;s creation; and he is largely occupied with
Diderot&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es philosophiques</i>, though
his book is written at Voltaire. The second volume is devoted to
<i lang="fr">Candide</i> and the <i lang="fr">Pr&eacute;cis</i> of
Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon&mdash;not very fierce
performances.] Lord Morley, as it happens, does not make this
chronological mistake in his earlier work on Voltaire, where he rightly
represents him as beginning his attack on &ldquo;the Infamous&rdquo;
after he had settled at Ferney (1758). His &ldquo;fierce
mockeries&rdquo; begin at the earliest <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>in 1761. The mistake
may have arisen through taking as true the fictitious date of 1736 for
the writing of the <i lang="fr">Examen Important de Milord
Bolingbroke</i>. It belongs to 1767. Buckle&rsquo;s error, it may be
noted, is repeated by so careful a student as Dr. Redlich, <i>Local
Government in England</i>, Eng. tr. 1903, i, 64.</p>

<p id="ch17.10" class="par">10. The rest of Voltaire&rsquo;s long life
was a sleepless and dexterous warfare, by all manner of literary
stratagem,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14473src" href="#xd21e14473"
name="xd21e14473src">62</a> facilitated by vast literary fame and ample
acquired wealth, against what he called &ldquo;the
Infamous&rdquo;&mdash;the Church and the creed which he found still
swift to slay for mere variation of belief, and slow to let any good
thing be wrought for the bettering of men&rsquo;s lives. Of his
prodigious literary performance it is probably within the truth to say
that in respect of rapid influence on the general intelligence of the
world it has never been equalled by any one man&rsquo;s writing; and
that, whatever its measure of error and of personal misdirection, its
broader influence was invariably for peace on earth, for tolerance
among men, and for reason in all things. His faults were many, and some
were serious; but to no other man of his age, save possibly Beccaria,
can be attributed so much beneficent accomplishment. He can perhaps
better be estimated as a force than as a man. So great was the area of
his literary energy that he is inevitably inadequate at many points.
Lessing could successfully impugn him in drama; Diderot in metaphysic;
Gibbon in history; and it is noteworthy that all of these men<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14512src" href="#xd21e14512" name=
"xd21e14512src">63</a> at different times criticized him with asperity,
testing him by the given item of performance, and disparaging his
personality. Yet in his own way he was a greater power than any of
them; and his range, as distinguished from his depth, outgoes theirs.
In sum, he was the greatest mental fighter of his age, perhaps of any
age: in that aspect he is a &ldquo;power-house&rdquo; not to be matched
in human history; and his polemic is mainly for good. It was a
distinguished English academic who declared that &ldquo;civilization
owes more to Voltaire than to all the Fathers of the Church put
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>together.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14532src" href="#xd21e14532" name="xd21e14532src">64</a> If in a
literary way he hated his personal foes, much more did he hate cruelty
and bigotry; and it was his work more than any that made impossible a
repetition in Europe of such clerical crimes as the hanging of the
Protestant pastor, La Rochette; the execution of the Protestant, Calas,
on an unproved and absurdly false charge; the torture of his widow and
children; the beheading of the lad La Barre for ill-proved
blasphemy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14538src" href="#xd21e14538"
name="xd21e14538src">65</a> As against his many humanities, there is
not to be charged on him one act of public malevolence. In his
relations with his fickle admirer, <span class="sc">Frederick the
Great</span>, and with others of his fellow-thinkers, he and they
painfully brought home to freethinkers the lesson that for them as for
all men there is a personal art of life that has to be learned, over
and above the rectification of opinion. But he and the others wrought
immensely towards that liberation alike from unreason and from bondage
which must precede any great improvement of human things.</p>
<p class="par">Voltaire&rsquo;s constant burden was that religion was
not only untrue but pernicious, and when he was not dramatically
showing this of Christianity, as in his poem <i lang="fr">La Ligue</i>
(1723), he was saying it by implication in such plays as <i lang=
"fr">Za&iuml;re</i> (1732) and <i lang="fr">Mahomet</i> (1742), dealing
with the fanaticism of Islam; while in the <i lang="fr">Essai sur les
m&oelig;urs</i> (1756), really a broad survey of general history, and
in the <i lang="fr">Si&egrave;cle de Louis XIV</i>, he applied the
method of Montesquieu, with pungent criticism thrown in. Later, he
added to his output direct criticisms of the Christian books, as in the
<i lang="fr">Examen important de Milord Bolingbroke</i> (1767), and the
<i lang="fr">Recherches historiques sur le Christianisme</i> (? 1769),
continuing all his former lines of activity. Meanwhile, with the aid of
his companion the <span class="sc">Marquise du Chatelet</span>, an
accomplished mathematician, he had done much to popularize the physics
of Newton and discredit the scientific fallacies of the system of
Descartes; all the while preaching a Newtonian but rather agnostic
deism. This is the purport of his <i lang="fr">Philosophe Ignorant</i>,
his longest philosophical essay.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14578src"
href="#xd21e14578" name="xd21e14578src">66</a> The destruction of
Lisbon by the earthquake <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>of 1755 seems to have shaken him
in his deistic faith, since the upshot of his poem on that subject is
to leave the moral government of the universe an absolute enigma; and
in the later <i lang="fr">Candide</i> (1759) he attacks theistic
optimism with his matchless ridicule. Indeed, as early as 1749, in his
<i lang="fr">Trait&eacute; de la M&eacute;taphysique</i>, written for
the Marquise du Chatelet, he reaches virtually pantheistic positions in
defence of the God-idea, declaring with Spinoza that deity can be
neither good nor bad. But, like so many professed pantheists, he
relapsed, and he never accepted the atheistic view; on the contrary, we
find him arguing absurdly enough, in his <i>Homily on Atheism</i>
(1765), that atheism had been the destruction of morality in
Rome;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14593src" href="#xd21e14593" name=
"xd21e14593src">67</a> on the publication of d&rsquo;Holbach&rsquo;s
<i>System of Nature</i> in 1770 he threw off an article <i lang=
"fr">Dieu: r&eacute;ponse au Syst&egrave;me de la Nature</i>, where he
argued on the old deistic lines; and his tale of <i>Jenni; or, the Sage
and the Atheist</i> (1775), is a polemic on the same theme. By this
time the inconsistent deism of his youth had itself been discredited
among the more thoroughgoing freethinkers; and for years it had been
said in one section of literary society that Voltaire after all
&ldquo;is a bigot; he is a deist!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14615src" href="#xd21e14615" name="xd21e14615src">68</a></p>
<p class="par">But for freethinkers of all schools the supreme service
of Voltaire lay in his twofold triumph over the spirit of religious
persecution. He had contrived at once to make it hateful and to make it
ridiculous; and it is a great theistic poet of our own day that has
pronounced his blade the</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e14636">sharpest, shrewdest steel that ever
stabbed</p>
<p class="line">To death Imposture through the armour joints.<a class=

</div>
<p class="par first">To be perfect, the tribute should have noted that
he hated cruelty much more than imposture; and such is the note of the
whole movement of which his name was the oriflamme. Voltaire personally
was at once the most pugnacious and the most forgiving of men. Few of
the Christians who hated him had so often as he fulfilled their own
precept of returning good for evil to enemies; and none excelled him in
hearty philanthropy. It is notable that most of the humanitarian ideas
of the latter half of the century&mdash;the demand for the reform of
criminal treatment, the denunciation of war and slavery, the insistence
on good government, and toleration of all creeds&mdash;are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>more
definitely associated with the freethinking than with any religious
party, excepting perhaps the laudable but uninfluential sect of
Quakers.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The character of Voltaire is still the subject of
chronic debate; but the old deadlock of laudation and abuse is being
solved in a critical recognition of him as a man of genius flawed by
the instability which genius so commonly involves. Carlyle (that model
of serenity), while dwelling on his perpetual perturbations,
half-humanely suggests that we should think of him as one constantly
hag-ridden by maladies of many kinds; and this recognition is really
even more important in Voltaire&rsquo;s case than in Carlyle&rsquo;s
own. He was &ldquo;a bundle of nerves,&rdquo; and the clear light of
his sympathetic intelligence was often blown aside by gusts of
passion&mdash;often enough excusably. But while his temperamental
weaknesses exposed him at times to humiliation, and often to sarcasm;
and while his compelled resort to constant stratagem made him more
prone to trickery than his admirers can well care to think him, the
balance of his character is abundantly on the side of generosity and
humanity.</p>
<p class="par">One of the most unjustifiable of recent attacks upon him
(one regrets to have to say it) came from the pen of the late Prof.
Churton Collins. In his book on <i>Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Rousseau
in England</i> (1908) that critic gives in the main an unbiassed
account of Voltaire&rsquo;s English experience; but at one point (p.
39) he plunges into a violent impeachment with the slightest possible
justification. He in effect adopts the old allegation of Ruffhead, the
biographer of Pope&mdash;a statement repeated by Johnson&mdash;that
Voltaire used his acquaintance with Pope and Bolingbroke to play the
spy on them, conveying information to Walpole, for which he was
rewarded. The whole story collapses upon critical examination.
Ruffhead&rsquo;s story is, in brief, that Pope purposely lied to
Voltaire as to the authorship of certain published letters attacking
Walpole. They were by Bolingbroke; but Pope, questioned by Voltaire,
said they were his own, begging him to keep the fact absolutely secret.
Next day at court everyone was speaking of the letters as Pope&rsquo;s;
and Pope accordingly knew that Voltaire was a traitor. For this tale
there is absolutely nothing but hearsay evidence. Ruffhead, as Johnson
declared, knew nothing of Pope, and simply used Warburton&rsquo;s
material. The one quasi-confirmation cited by Mr. Collins is
Bolingbroke&rsquo;s letter to Swift (May 18, 1727) asking him to
&ldquo;insinuate&rdquo; that Walpole&rsquo;s only ground for ascribing
the letters to Bolingbroke &ldquo;is the authority of one of his spies
... who reports, <i>not what he hears ... but what he
guesses</i>.&rdquo; This is an absolute contradiction of the Pope
story, at two points. It refers to a <i>guess</i> at Bolingbroke, and
tells of no citation from Pope. To put it as confirming the charge is
to exhibit a complete failure of judgment. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">After this irrational argument, Mr. Collins offers a
worse. He admits (p. 43) that Voltaire always remained on friendly
terms with both Pope and Bolingbroke; but adds that this &ldquo;can
scarcely be alleged as a proof of his innocence, for neither Pope nor
Bolingbroke would, for such an offence, have been likely to quarrel
with a man in a position so peculiar as that of Voltaire. <i>His
flattery was pleasant</i>....&rdquo; Such an argument is worse than
nugatory. That Bolingbroke spoke ill in private of Voltaire on general
grounds counts for nothing. He did the same of Pope and of nearly all
his friends. Mr. Collins further accuses Voltaire of baseness,
falsehood, and hypocrisy on the mere score of his habit of extravagant
flattery. This was notoriously the French mode in that age; but it had
been just as much the mode in seventeenth-century England, from the
Jacobean translators of the Bible to Dryden&mdash;to name no others.
And Mr. Collins in effect charges systematic hypocrisy upon both Pope
and Bolingbroke.</p>
<p class="par">Other stories of Ruffhead&rsquo;s against Voltaire are
equally improbable and ill-vouched&mdash;as Mr. Collins incidentally
admits, though he forgets the admission. They all come from Warburton,
himself convicted of double-dealing with Pope; and they finally stand
for the hatred of Frenchmen which was so common in eighteenth-century
England, and is apparently not yet quite extinct. Those who would have
a sane, searching, and competent estimate of Voltaire, leaning humanely
to the side of goodwill, should turn to the <i>Voltaire</i> of M.
Champion. A brief estimate was attempted by the present writer in the
<i>R. P. A. Annual</i> for 1912.</p>

<p id="ch17.11" class="par">11. It is difficult to realize how far the
mere demand for tolerance which sounds from Voltaire&rsquo;s plays and
poems before he has begun to assail credences was a signal and an
inspiration to new thinkers. Certain it is that the principle of
toleration, passed on by Holland to England, was regarded by the
orthodox priesthood in France as the abomination of desolation, and
resisted by them with all their power. But the contagion was
unquenchable. It was presumably in Holland that there were printed in
1738 the two volumes of <i lang="fr">Lettres sur la religion
essentielle &agrave; l&rsquo;homme, distingu&eacute;e de ce qui
n&rsquo;en est que l&rsquo;accessoire</i>, by Marie Huber, a Genevese
lady living in Lyons; also the two following parts (1739), replying to
criticisms on the earlier. In its gentle way, the book stands very
distinctly for the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and ethical principle in
religion, denying that the deity demands from men either service or
worship, or that he can be wronged by their deeds, or that he can
punish them eternally for their sins. This was one of the first French
fruits, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>after Voltaire, of the English deistic
influence;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14686src" href="#xd21e14686"
name="xd21e14686src">70</a> and it is difficult to understand how the
authoress escaped molestation. Perhaps the memory of the persecution
inflicted on the mystic Madame Guyon withheld the hand of power. As it
was, four Protestant theologians opened fire on her, regarding her
doctrine as hostile to Christianity. One pastor wrote from Geneva, one
from Amsterdam, and two professors from Zurich&mdash;the two last in
Latin.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14695src" href="#xd21e14695" name=
"xd21e14695src">71</a></p>
<p class="par">From about 1746 onwards, the rationalist movement in
eighteenth-century France rapidly widens and deepens. The number of
rationalistic writers, despite the press laws which in that age
inflicted the indignity of imprisonment on half the men of letters,
increased from decade to decade, and the rising prestige of the
<i lang="fr">philosophes</i> in connection with the <i lang=
"fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i> (1751&ndash;72) gave new courage to
writers and printers. At once the ecclesiastical powers saw in the
<i lang="fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i> a dangerous enemy; and in January,
1752, the Sorbonne condemned a thesis &ldquo;To the celestial
Jerusalem,&rdquo; by the Abb&eacute; de Prades. It had at first (1751)
been received with official applause, but was found on study to breathe
the spirit of the new work,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14728src" href=
"#xd21e14728" name="xd21e14728src">72</a> to which the Abb&eacute; had
contributed, and whose editor, Diderot, was his friend. Sooth to say,
it contained not a little matter calculated to act as a solvent of
faith. Under the form of a vindication of orthodox Catholicism, it
negated alike Descartes and Leibnitz; and declared that the science of
Newton and the Dutch physiologists was a better defence of religion
than the theses of Clarke, Descartes, Cudworth, and Malebranche, which
made for materialism. The handling, too, of the question of natural
<i>versus</i> revealed religion, in which &ldquo;theism&rdquo; is
declared to be superior to all religions <i lang="la">si unam excipias
veram</i>, &ldquo;if you except the one true,&rdquo; might well arouse
distrust in a vigilant Catholic reader.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14744src" href="#xd21e14744" name="xd21e14744src">73</a> The
whole argument savours far more of the scientific comparative method
than was natural in the work of an eighteenth-century seminarist; and
the principle, &ldquo;Either we are ocular witnesses of the facts or we
know them only by hearsay,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14753src"
href="#xd21e14753" name="xd21e14753src">74</a> was plainly as dangerous
to the Christian creed as to any other. According to Naigeon,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14758src" href="#xd21e14758" name=
"xd21e14758src">75</a> the treatise was wholly the work of de Prades
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>and another Abb&eacute;, Yvon;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e14765src" href="#xd21e14765" name="xd21e14765src">76</a> but
it remains probable that Diderot inspired not a little of the
reasoning; and the clericals, bent on putting down the <i lang=
"fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i>, professed to have discovered that he was
the real author of the thesis. Either this belief or a desire to strike
at the <i lang="fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i> through one of its
collaborators<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14790src" href="#xd21e14790"
name="xd21e14790src">77</a> was the motive of the absurdly belated
censure. Such a fiasco evoked much derision from the philosophic party,
particularly from Voltaire; and the Sorbonne compassed a new revenge.
Soon after came the formal condemnation of the first two volumes of the
<i lang="fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i>, of which the second had just
appeared.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14802src" href="#xd21e14802" name=
"xd21e14802src">78</a></p>
<p class="par">D&rsquo;Argenson, watching in his vigilant retirement
the course of things on all hands, sees in the episode a new and
dangerous development, &ldquo;the establishment of a veritable
inquisition in France, of which the Jesuits joyfully take
charge,&rdquo; though he repeatedly remarks also on the eagerness of
the Jansenists to outgo the Jesuits.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14813src" href="#xd21e14813" name="xd21e14813src">79</a> But soon
the publication of the <i lang="fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i> is resumed;
and in 1753 D&rsquo;Argenson contentedly notes the official bestowal of
&ldquo;tacit permissions to print secretly&rdquo; books which could not
obtain formal authorization. The permission had been given first by the
President Malesherbes; but even when that official lost the
king&rsquo;s confidence the practice was continued by the lieutenant of
police.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14821src" href="#xd21e14821" name=
"xd21e14821src">80</a> Despite the staggering blow of the suppression
of the <i lang="fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i>, the <i lang=
"fr">philosophes</i> speedily triumphed. So great was the discontent
even at court that soon (1752) Madame de Pompadour and some of the
ministry invited D&rsquo;Alembert and Diderot to resume their work,
&ldquo;observing a necessary reserve in all things touching religion
and authority.&rdquo; Madame de Pompadour was in fact, as
D&rsquo;Alembert said at her death, &ldquo;in her heart one of
ours,&rdquo; as was D&rsquo;Argenson. But D&rsquo;Alembert, in a long
private conference with D&rsquo;Argenson, insisted that they must write
in freedom like the English and the Prussians, or not at all. Already
there was talk of suppressing the philosophic works of Condillac, which
a few years before had gone uncondemned; and freedom must be preserved
at any cost. &ldquo;I acquiesce,&rdquo; writes the ex-Minister,
&ldquo;in these arguments.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14833src"
href="#xd21e14833" name="xd21e14833src">81</a></p>
<p class="par">Curiously enough, the freethinking Fontenelle, who for a
time (the dates are elusive) held the office of royal censor, was more
rigorous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>than other officials who had not his reputation
for heterodoxy. One day he refused to pass a certain manuscript, and
the author put the challenge: &ldquo;You, sir, who have published the
<i lang="fr">Histoire des Oracles</i>, refuse me this?&rdquo; &ldquo;If
I had been the censor of the <i>Oracles</i>,&rdquo; replied Fontenelle,
&ldquo;I should not have passed it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14848src" href="#xd21e14848" name="xd21e14848src">82</a> And he
had cause for his caution. The unlucky Tercier, who, engrossed in
&ldquo;foreign affairs,&rdquo; had authorized the publication of the
<i lang="fr">De l&rsquo;Esprit</i> of Helv&eacute;tius, was compelled
to resign the censorship, and severely rebuked by the Paris
Parlement.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14858src" href="#xd21e14858"
name="xd21e14858src">83</a> But the culture-history of the period, like
the political, was one of ups and downs. From time to time the
philosophic party had friends at court, as in the persons of the
Marquis D&rsquo;Argenson, Malesherbes, and the Duc de Choiseul, of whom
the last-named engineered the suppression of the Jesuits.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14863src" href="#xd21e14863" name=
"xd21e14863src">84</a> Then there were checks to the forward movement
in the press, as when, in 1770, Choiseul was forced to retire on the
advent of Madame Du Barry. The output of freethinking books is after
that year visibly curtailed. But nothing could arrest the forward
movement of opinion.</p>
<div id="ch17.12" class="par">12. A new era of propaganda and struggle
had visibly begun. In the earlier part of the century freethought had
been disseminated largely by way of manuscripts<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14871src" href="#xd21e14871" name="xd21e14871src">85</a> and
reprints of foreign books in translation; but from the middle onwards,
despite denunciations and prohibitions, new books multiply. To the
policy of tacit toleration imposed by Malesherbes a violent end was
temporarily put in 1757, when the Jesuits obtained a proclamation of
the death penalty against all writers who should attack the Christian
religion, directly or indirectly. It was doubtless under the menace of
this decree that Deslandes, before dying in 1757, caused to be drawn up
by two notaries an <i>acte</i> by which he disavowed and denounced not
only his <i lang="fr">Grands hommes morts en plaisantant</i> but all
his other works, whether printed or in MS., in which he had &ldquo;laid
down principles or sustained sentiments contrary to the spirit of
religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14883src" href=
"#xd21e14883" name="xd21e14883src">86</a> But in 1764, on the
suppression of the Jesuits, there was a vigorous resumption of
propaganda. &ldquo;There are books,&rdquo; writes Voltaire in 1765,
&ldquo;of which forty years ago one would not have trusted the
manuscript to one&rsquo;s friends, and of which there are now published
six editions in eighteen months.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14889src" href="#xd21e14889" name="xd21e14889src">87</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>Voltaire single-handed produced a library; and
d&rsquo;Holbach is credited with at least a dozen freethinking
treatises, every one remarkable in its day. But there were many more
combatants. The reputation of Voltaire has overshadowed even that of
his leading contemporaries, and theirs and his have further obscured
that of the lesser men; but a list of miscellaneous freethinking works
by French writers during the century, up to the Revolution, will serve
to show how general was the activity after 1750. It will be seen that
very little was published in France in the period in which English
deism was most fecund. A noticeable activity of publication begins
about 1745. But it was when the long period of chronic warfare ended
for France with the peace of Paris (1763); when she had lost India and
North America; when she had suppressed the Jesuit order (1764); and
when England had in the main turned from intellectual interests to the
pursuit of empire and the development of manufacturing industry, that
the released French intelligence<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14895src"
href="#xd21e14895" name="xd21e14895src">88</a> turned with irresistible
energy to the rational criticism of established opinions. The following

<p class="par first">[Barbier (<i lang="fr">Dict. des Ouvr. Anon.</i>,
2e &eacute;d. iii, 437) has a note concerning this <i>Voyage</i> which
pleasantly illustrates the strategy that went on in the issue of
freethinking books. An ex-censor of the period, he tells us, wrote a
note on the original edition pointing out that it contains (pp.
145&ndash;54) a tirade against &ldquo;Parlements.&rdquo; This passage
was &ldquo;suppressed to obtain permission to bring the book into
France,&rdquo; and a new passage attacking the Encyclop&eacute;distes
under the name of <i lang="fr">Pansophistes</i> was inserted at another
point. The ex-censor had a copy of an edition of 1767, in 12mo, better
printed than the first and on better paper. In this, at p. 87, line 30,
begins the attack on the Encyclop&eacute;distes, which continues to p.
93.</p>
<p class="par">If this is accurate, there has taken place a double
mystification. I possess a copy dated 1767, in 12mo, in which no page
has so many as 30 lines, and in which there has been no typographical
change whatever in pp. 87&ndash;93, where there is no mention of
Encyclop&eacute;distes. But pp. 145&ndash;54 are clearly a
typographical substitution, in different type, with fewer lines to the
page. Here there is a narrative about the <i lang="fr">Pansophistes</i>
of the imaginary &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Australie</span>&rdquo;; but
while it begins with enigmatic satire it ends by praising them for
bringing about a great intellectual and social reform.</p>
<p class="par">If the censure was induced to pass the book as it is in
this edition by this insertion, it was either very heedless or very
indulgent. There is a sweeping attack on the papacy (pp. 91&ndash;99),
and another on the Jesuits (pp. 100&ndash;102); and it leans a good
deal towards republicanism. But on a balance, though clearly
anti-clerical, it is rather socio-political than freethinking in its
criticism. The words on the title-page, <i lang="fr">traduit sur le
manuscrit anglois</i>, are of course pure mystification. It is a
romance of the <i>Utopia</i> school, and criticizes English conditions
as well as French.]</p>

<p id="ch17.13" class="par">13. It will be noted that after
1770&mdash;coincidently, indeed, with a renewed restraint upon the
press&mdash;there is a notable falling-off in the freethinking output.
Rationalism had now permeated educated France; and, for different but
analogous reasons, the stress of discussion gradually shifted as it had
done in England. France in 1760 stood to the religious problem somewhat
as England did in 1730, repeating the deistic evolution with a
difference. By that time England was committed to the new paths of
imperialism and commercialism; whereas France, thrown back on the life
of ideas and on her own politico-economic problems, went on producing
the abundant propaganda we have noted, and, alongside of it, an
independent propaganda of economics and politics. At the end of 1767,
the leading French diarist<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16595src" href=
"#xd21e16595" name="xd21e16595src">103</a> notes that &ldquo;there is
formed at Paris a new sect, called the Economists,&rdquo; and names its
leading personages, Quesnay, Mirabeau the elder, the Abb&eacute;
Baudeau, Mercier de la Rivi&egrave;re, and Turgot. These developed the
doctrine of agricultural or &ldquo;real&rdquo; production which so
stimulated and influenced Adam Smith. But immediately
afterwards<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16601src" href="#xd21e16601"
name="xd21e16601src">104</a> the diarist notes a rival sect, the school
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>of Forbonnais, who founded mainly on the
importance of commerce and manufactures. Each &ldquo;sect&rdquo; had
its journal. The intellectual ferment had inevitably fructified thought
upon economic as upon historical, religious, and scientific problems;
and there was in operation a fourfold movement, all tending to make
possible the immense disintegration of the State which began in 1789.
After the Economists came the &ldquo;Patriots,&rdquo; who directed
towards the actual political machine the spirit of investigation and
reform. And the whole effective movement is not unplausibly to be dated
from the fall of the Jesuits in 1764.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16608src" href="#xd21e16608" name="xd21e16608src">105</a>
Inevitably the forces interacted: Montesquieu and Rousseau alike dealt
with both the religious and the social issues; d&rsquo;Holbach in his
first polemic, the <i lang="fr">Christianisme
d&eacute;voil&eacute;</i>, opens the stern impeachment of kings and
rulers which he develops so powerfully in the <i lang="fr">Essai sur
les Pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s</i>; and the <i lang=
"fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i> sent its search-rays over all the fields
of inquiry. But of the manifold work done by the French intellect in
the second and third generations of the eighteenth century, the most
copious and the most widely influential body of writings that can be
put under one category is that of which we have above made a
chronological conspectus.</p>
<p class="par">Of these works the merit is of course very various; but
the total effect of the propaganda was formidable, and some of the
treatises are extremely effective. The <i lang="fr">Examen critique</i>
of Burigny,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16630src" href="#xd21e16630"
name="xd21e16630src">106</a> for instance, which quickly won a wide
circulation when printed, is one of the most telling attacks thus far
made on the Christian system, raising as it does most of the issues
fought over by modern criticism. It tells indeed of a whole generation
of private investigation and debate; and the Abb&eacute; Bergier,
assuming it to be the work of <span class="corr" id="xd21e16633" title=
"Corrected by author from: Freret">Fr&eacute;ret</span>, in whose name
it is published, avows that its author &ldquo;has written it in the
same style as his academic dissertations: he has spread over it the
same erudition; he seems to have read everything and mastered
everything.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16636src" href=
"#xd21e16636" name="xd21e16636src">107</a> Perhaps not the least
effective part of the book is the chapter which asks: &ldquo;Are men
more perfect since the coming of Jesus Christ?&rdquo;; and it is here
that the clerical reply is most feeble. The critic cites the claims
made by apologists as to the betterment of life by Christianity, and
then contrasts with those claims the thousand-and-one lamentations by
Christian writers over the utter badness of all the life around them.
Bergier in reply follows the tactic habitually employed in the same
difficulty to-day: he ignores <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246"
href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>the fact that his own
apologists have been claiming a vast betterment, and contends that
religion is not to be blamed for the evils it condemns. Not by such
furtive sophistry could the Church turn the attack, which, as Bergier
bitterly observes, was being made by Voltaire in a new book every
year.</p>
<p class="par">As always, the weaker side of the critical propaganda is
its effort at reconstruction. As in England, so in France, the faithful
accused the critics of &ldquo;pulling down without building up,&rdquo;
when in point of fact their chief error was to build up&mdash;that is,
to rewrite the history of human thought&mdash;before they had the
required materials, or had even mastered those which existed. Thus
Voltaire and Rousseau alike framed &agrave; priori syntheses of the
origins of religion and society. But there were closer thinkers than
they in the rationalistic ranks. Fontenelle&rsquo;s essay <i lang=
"fr">De l&rsquo;origine des fables</i>, though not wholly exempt from
error, admittedly lays aright the foundations of mythology and
hierology; and De Brosses in his treatise <i lang="fr">Du Culte des
dieux f&eacute;tiches</i> (1760) does a similar service on the side of
anthropology. Meister&rsquo;s essay <i lang="fr">De l&rsquo;origine des
principes religieux</i> is full of insight and breadth; and, despite
some errors due to the backwardness of anthropology, essentially
scientific in temper and standpoint. His later essay, <i lang="fr">De
la morale naturelle</i>, shows the same independence and fineness of
speculation, seeming indeed to tell of a character which missed fame by
reason of over-delicacy of fibre and lack of the driving force which
marked the foremost men of that tempestuous time. Vauvenargues&rsquo;s
essay <i lang="fr">De la suffisance de la religion naturelle</i> is no
less clinching, granted its deism. So, on the side of philosophy,
Mirabaud, who was secretary of the Acad&eacute;mie from 1742 to 1755,
handles the problem of the relation of deism to ethics&mdash;if the
posthumous essays in the <i lang="fr">Recueil philosophique</i> be
indeed his&mdash;in a much more philosophic fashion than does Voltaire,
arguing unanswerably for the ultimate self-dependence of morals. The
<i lang="fr">Lettre de Thrasybule &agrave; Leucippe</i>, ascribed to
<span class="corr" id="xd21e16670" title=
"Corrected by author from: Freret">Fr&eacute;ret</span>, again, is a
notably skilful attack on theism.</p>
<p id="ch17.14" class="par">14. One of the most remarkable of the
company in some respects is <span class="sc">Nicolas-Antoine
Boulanger</span> (1722&ndash;1759), of whom Diderot gives a vivid
account in a sketch prefixed to the posthumous <i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;Antiquit&eacute; d&eacute;voil&eacute;e par ses usages</i>
(1766). At the Coll&egrave;ge de Beauvais, Boulanger was so little
stimulated by his scholastic teachers that they looked for nothing from
him in his maturity. When, however, at the age of seventeen, he began
to study mathematics and architecture, his faculties began to develop;
and the life, first of a military engineer in 1743&ndash;44, and later
in the service <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>of the notable department of Roads and
Bridges&mdash;the most efficient of all State services under Louis
XV&mdash;made him an independent and energetic thinker. The chronic
spectacle of the <i lang="fr">corv&eacute;e</i>, the forced labour of
peasants on the roads, moved him to indignation; but he sought peace in
manifold study, the engineer&rsquo;s contact with nature arousing in
him all manner of speculations, geological and sociological. Seeking
for historic light, he mastered Latin, which he had failed to do at
school, reading widely and voraciously; and when the Latins failed to
yield him the light he craved he systematically mastered Greek, reading
the Greeks as hungrily and with as little satisfaction. Then he turned
indefatigably to Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic, gleaning at best verbal
clues which at length he wrought into a large, loose, imaginative yet
immensely erudite schema of ancient social evolution, in which the
physicist&rsquo;s pioneer study of the structure and development of the
globe controls the anthropologist&rsquo;s guesswork as to the
beginnings of human society. The whole is set forth in the bulky
posthumous work <i lang="fr">Recherches sur l&rsquo;origine du
despotisme oriental</i> (1761), and in the further treatise <i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;antiquit&eacute; d&eacute;voil&eacute;e</i> (3 tom. 1766),
which is but the concluding section of the first-named.</p>
<p class="par">It all yields nothing to modern science; the unwearying
research is all carried on, as it were, in the dark; and the sleepless
brain of the pioneer can but weave webs of impermanent speculation from
masses of unsifted and unmanageable material. Powers which to-day, on a
prepared ground of ascertained science, might yield the greatest
results, were wasted in a gigantic effort to build a social science out
of the chaos of undeciphered antiquity, natural and human. But the man
is nonetheless morally memorable. Diderot pictures him with a head
Socratically ugly, simple and innocent of life, gentle though
vivacious, reading Rabbinical Hebrew in his walks on the high roads,
suffering all his life from &ldquo;domestic persecution,&rdquo;
&ldquo;little contradictory though infinitely learned,&rdquo; and
capable of passing in a moment, on the stimulus of a new idea, into a
state of profound and entranced absorption. Diderot is always
enthusiastically generous in praise; but in reading and reviewing
Boulanger&rsquo;s work we can hardly refuse assent to his
friend&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;if ever man has shown in his career
the true characters of genius, it was he.&rdquo; His immense research
was all compassed in a life of thirty-seven years, occupied throughout
in an active profession; and the diction in which he sets forth his
imaginative construction of the past reveals a constant intensity of
thought rarely combined with scholarly knowledge. But it was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>an age of concentrated energy, carrying in its
womb the Revolution. The perusal of Boulanger is a sufficient safeguard
against the long-cherished hallucination that the French freethinking
of his age was but a sparkle of raillery.</p>
<p class="par">Even among some rationalists, however, who are content
to take hearsay report on these matters, there appears still to subsist
a notion that the main body of the French freethinkers of the
eighteenth century were mere scoffers, proceeding upon no basis of
knowledge and with no concern for research. Such an opinion is possible
only to those who have not examined their work. To say nothing more of
the effort of Boulanger, an erudition much more exact than
Voltaire&rsquo;s and a deeper insight than his and Rousseau&rsquo;s
into the causation of primitive religion inspires the writings of men
like Burigny and <span class="corr" id="xd21e16699" title=
"Corrected by author from: Freret">Fr&eacute;ret</span> on the one
hand, and Fontenelle and Meister on the other. The philosophic reach of
Diderot, one of the most convinced opponents of the ruling religion,
was recognized by Goethe. And no critic of the &ldquo;<i lang=
"fr">philosophes</i>&rdquo; handled more uncompromisingly than did
Dumarsais<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16705src" href="#xd21e16705" name=
"xd21e16705src">108</a> the vanity of the assumption that a man became
a philosopher by merely setting himself in opposition to orthodox
belief. Dumarsais, long scholastically famous for his youthful treatise
<i lang="fr">Des Tropes</i>, lived up to his standard, whatever some of
the more eminent <i lang="fr">philosophes</i> may have done, being
found eminently lovable by pietists who knew him; while for
D&rsquo;Alembert he was &ldquo;the La Fontaine of the
philosophers&rdquo; in virtue of his lucid simplicity of
style.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16767src" href="#xd21e16767" name=
"xd21e16767src">109</a> The <i lang="fr">Analyse de la religion
chr&eacute;tienne</i> printed under his name in some editions of the
<i lang="fr">&Eacute;vangile de la Raison</i> has been pronounced
supposititious. It seems to be the work of at least two hands<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16776src" href="#xd21e16776" name=
"xd21e16776src">110</a> of different degrees of instruction;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>but, apart from some errors due to one of these,
it does him no discredit, being a vigorous criticism of Scriptural
contradictions and anomalies, such as a &ldquo;Jansenist atheist&rdquo;
might well compose, though it makes the usual profession of deistic
belief.</p>
<p class="par">Later polemic works, inspired by those above noticed,
reproduce some of their arguments, but with an advance in literary
skill, as in the anonymous <i lang="fr">Bon Sens</i> given forth (1772)
by Diderot and d&rsquo;Holbach as the work of Jean Meslier, but really
an independent compilation, embodying other arguments with his, and
putting the whole with a concision and brilliancy to which he could
make no approach. Pr&eacute;montval, a bad writer,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e16786src" href="#xd21e16786" name="xd21e16786src">111</a>
contrives nonetheless to say many pungent things of a deistic order in
his <i lang="fr">Diog&egrave;ne de d&rsquo;Alembert</i>, and, following
Marie Huber, puts forward the formula of religion <i>versus</i>
theology, which has done so much duty in the nineteenth century. Of the
whole literature it is not too much to say that it covered cogently
most of the important grounds of latter-day debate, from the questions
of revelation and the doctrine of torments to the bases of ethics and
the problem of deity; and it would be hard to show that the nineteenth
century has handled the main issues with more sincerity, lucidity, or
logic than were attained by Frenchmen in the eighteenth. To-day, no
doubt, in the light of a century and a-half of scientific, historic,
and philosophic accumulation, the rationalist case is put with more
profundity and accuracy by many writers than it could be in the
eighteenth century. But we have to weigh the freethinkers of that age
against their opponents, and the French performers against those of
other countries, to make a fair estimate. When this is done their
credit is safe. When German and other writers say with Tholuck that
&ldquo;unbelief entered Germany not by the weapons of mere wit and
scoffing as in France; it grounded itself on learned
research,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16817src" href=
"#xd21e16817" name="xd21e16817src">112</a> they merely prove their
ignorance of French culture-history. An abundance of learned research
in France preceded the triumphant campaign of Voltaire, who did most of
the witty writing on the subject; and whose light artillery was to the
last reinforced by the heavier guns of d&rsquo;Holbach. It is only in
the analysis of the historical problem by the newer tests of
anthropology and hierology, and in the light of latterly discovered
documents, that our generation has made much advance on the strenuous
pioneers of the age of Voltaire. And even in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>field of anthropology the sound thinking of
Fontenelle and De Brosses long preceded any equally valid work by
rationalists in Germany; though Spencer of Cambridge had preceded them
in his work of constructive orthodoxy.</p>
<p id="ch17.15" class="par">15. Though the bibliographers claim to have
traced the authorship in most cases, such works were in the first
instance generally published anonymously,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16830src" href="#xd21e16830" name="xd21e16830src">113</a> as were
those of Voltaire, d&rsquo;Holbach, and the leading freethinkers; and
the clerical policy of suppression had the result of leaving them
generally unanswered, save in anonymous writings, when they
nevertheless got into private circulation. It was generally impolitic
that an official answer should appear to a book which was officially
held not to exist; so that the orthodox defence was long confined
mainly to the classic performances of Pascal, Bossuet, Huet,
F&eacute;nelon, and some outsiders such as the Protestant Abbadie, who
settled first in Berlin and later in London. The polemic of every one
of the writers named is a work of ability; even that of Abbadie
(<i lang="fr">Trait&eacute; de la V&eacute;rit&eacute; de la religion
chr&eacute;tienne</i>, 1684), though now little known, was in its day
much esteemed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16836src" href="#xd21e16836"
name="xd21e16836src">114</a> In the age of Louis XIV those classic
answers to unbelief were by believers held to be conclusive; and thus
far the French defence was certainly more thorough and philosophical
than the English. But French freethought, which in Herbert&rsquo;s day
had given the lead to English, now drew new energy from the English
growth; and the general arguments of the old apologists did not
explicitly meet the new attack. Their books having been written to meet
the mostly unpublished objections of previous generations, the Church
through its chosen policy had the air of utter inability to confute the
newer propaganda, though some apologetic treatises of fair power did
appear, in particular those of the Abb&eacute; Bergier.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16839src" href="#xd21e16839" name=
"xd21e16839src">115</a> By the avowal of a Christian historian,
&ldquo;So low had the talents of the once illustrious Church of France
fallen that in the latter part of the eighteenth century, when
Christianity itself was assailed, not one champion of note appeared in
its ranks; and when the convocation of the clergy, in 1770, published
their famous anathema against the dangers of unbelief, and offered
rewards for the best <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251"
name="pb251">251</a>]</span>essays in defence of the Christian faith,
the productions called forth were so despicable that they sensibly
injured the cause of religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16872src" href="#xd21e16872" name="xd21e16872src">116</a></p>
<p class="par">The freethinking attack, in fact, had now become
overwhelming. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order (1764)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16880src" href="#xd21e16880" name=
"xd21e16880src">117</a> the press grew practically more and more free;
and when, after the accession of Pope Clement XIV (1769), the
freethinking books circulated with less and less restraint, Bergier
extended his attack on deism, and deists and clerics joined in
answering the atheistic <i lang="fr">Syst&egrave;me de la Nature</i> of
d&rsquo;Holbach. But by this time the deistic books were legion, and
the political battle over the taxation of Church property had become
the more pressing problem, especially seeing that the mass of the
people remained conforming. The manifesto of the clergy in 1770 was
accompanied by an address to the king &ldquo;On the evil results of
liberty of thought and printing,&rdquo; following up a previous appeal
by the pope;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16886src" href="#xd21e16886"
name="xd21e16886src">118</a> and in consideration of the donation by
the clergy of sixteen million livres the Government recommended the
Parlement of Paris to proceed against impious books. There seems
accordingly to have been some hindrance to publication for a year or
two; but in 1772 appeared the <i lang="fr">Bon Sens</i> of
d&rsquo;Holbach and Diderot; and there was no further serious check,
the Jesuits being disbanded by the pope in 1773.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The English view that French orthodoxy made a
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; defence to the freethinking attack as compared with
what was done in England (Sir J. F. Stephen, <i lang="la">Hor&aelig;
Sabbatic&aelig;</i>, 2nd. ser. p. 281; Alison, as cited above) proceeds
on some misconception of the circumstances, which, as has been shown,
were substantially different in the two countries. Could the English
clergy have resorted to official suppression of deistic literature,
they too would doubtless have done so. Swift and Berkeley bitterly
desired to. But the view that the English defence was relatively
&ldquo;good,&rdquo; and that Butler&rsquo;s in particular was decisive,
is also, as we have seen, fallacious. In Sir Leslie Stephen&rsquo;s
analysis, as apart from his preamble, the orthodox defence is exhibited
as generally weak, and often absurd. Nothing could be more futile than
the three &ldquo;Pastoral Letters&rdquo; published by the Bishop of
London (1728, 1730, 1731) as counterblasts to the freethinking books of
this period. In France the defence began sooner, and was more profound
and even more methodical. Pascal at least went deeper, and Bossuet (in
his <i lang="fr">Discours sur <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252"
href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>l&rsquo;Histoire
Universelle</i>) more widely, into certain inward and outward problems
of the controversy than did any of the English apologists; Huet
produced, in his <i lang="la">Demonstratio Evangelica</i>, one of the
most methodical of all the defensive treatises of the time; Abbadie, as
before noted, gave great satisfaction, and certainly grappled zealously
with Hobbes and Spinoza; Allix, though no great dialectician, gave a
lead to English apologetics against the deists (above, p. 97), and was
even adapted by Paley; and F&eacute;nelon, though his <i lang=
"fr">Trait&eacute; de l&rsquo;Existence et des Attributs de Dieu</i>
(1712) and <i lang="fr">Lettres sur la Religion</i> (1716) are not very
powerful processes of reasoning, contributed through his reproduced
conversations (1710) with Ramsay a set of arguments at least as
plausible as anything on the English side, and, what is more notable,
marked by an amenity which almost no English apologist attained.</p>
<p class="par">The ground had been thus very fully covered by the
defence in France before the main battle in England began; and when a
new French campaign commenced with Voltaire, the defence against that
incomparable attack, so far as the system allowed of any, was probably
as good as it could have been made in England, save insofar as the
Protestants gave up modern miracles, while most of the Catholics
claimed them for their Church. Counterblasts such as the essay of
Linguet, <i lang="fr">Le Fanatisme des Philosophes</i> (1764), were but
general indictments of rationalism; and other apologetic treatises, as
we saw, handled only the most prominent books on the other side. It
should be noted, too, that as late as 1764 the police made it almost
impossible to obtain in Paris works of Voltaire recently printed in
Holland (Grimm, vii, 123, 133, 434). But, as Paley admitted with
reference to Gibbon (&ldquo;Who can refute a sneer?&rdquo;), the new
attack was in any case very hard to meet. A sneer is not hard to refute
when it is unfounded, inasmuch as it implies a proposition, which can
be rebutted or turned by another sneer. The Anglican Church had been
well enough pleased by the polemic sneers of Swift and Berkeley; but
the other side had the heavier guns, and of the mass of defences
produced in England nothing remains save in the neat compilation of
Paley. Alison&rsquo;s whole avowal might equally well apply to anything
produced in England as against Voltaire. The skeptical line of argument
for faith had been already employed by Huet and Pascal and
F&eacute;nelon, with visibly small success; Berkeley had achieved
nothing with it as against English deism; and Butler had no such effect
in his day in England as to induce French Catholics to use him. (He
does not appear to have been translated into French till 1821.)</p>
<p class="par">An Oratorian priest, again, translated the anti-deistic
essays of President Forbes; and the <i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es
Theologiques relatives aux erreurs du temps</i> of P&egrave;re Jamin
(1768; 4e &eacute;dit. 1773) were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253"
href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>thought worthy of being
translated into German, poor as they were. With their empty affirmation
of authority they suggest so much blank cartridge, which could avail
nothing with thinking men; and here doubtless the English defence makes
a better impression. But, on the other hand, Voltaire circulated widely
in England, and was no better answered there than in France. His attack
was, in truth, at many points peculiarly baffling, were it only by its
inimitable wit. The English replies to Spinoza, again, were as entirely
inefficient or deficient as the French; the only intelligent English
answers to Hume on Miracles (the replies on other issues were of no
account) made use of the French investigations of the Jansenist
miracles; and the replies to Gibbon were in general ignominious
failures.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, though the deeper reasonings of Diderot were
over the heads alike of the French and the English clergy, the <i lang=
"fr">Syst&egrave;me de la Nature</i> of d&rsquo;Holbach was met
skilfully enough at many points by G. J. Holland (1772), who, though
not a Frenchman, wrote excellent French, and supplied for French
readers a very respectable rejoinder;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16934src" href="#xd21e16934" name="xd21e16934src">119</a> whereas
in England there was practically none. In this case, of course, the
defence was deistic; as was that of Voltaire, who criticized
d&rsquo;Holbach as Bolingbroke attacked Spinoza and Hobbes. But the
<i lang="fr">Examen du Mat&eacute;rialisme</i> of the Abb&eacute;
Bergier (1771), who was a member of the Academy of Sciences, was at
least as good as anything that could then have been done in the Church
of England; and the same may be said of his reply to <span class="corr"
id="xd21e16943" title=
"Corrected by author from: Freret&rsquo;s">Fr&eacute;ret&rsquo;s</span>
(really Burigny&rsquo;s) <i lang="fr">Examen</i>. It is certainly poor
enough; but Bishop Watson used some of its arguments for his reply to
Paine. Broadly speaking, as we have said, much more of French than of
English intelligence had been turned to the dispute in the third
quarter of the century. In England, political and industrial discussion
relieved the pressure on creed; in France, before the Revolution, the
whole habit of absolutism tended to restrict discussion to questions of
creed; and the attack would in any case have had the best of it,
because it embodied all the critical forces hitherto available. The
controversy thus went much further than the pre-Humian issues raised in
England; and the English orthodoxy of the end of the century was, in
comparison, intellectually as weak as politically and socially it was
strong. In France, from the first, the greater intellectual freedom in
social intercourse, exemplified in the readiness of women to declare
themselves freethinkers (cp. Jamin, as cited, ch. xix, &sect; 1), would
have made the task of the apologists harder even had they been more
competent.</p>

But the book has long been discredited (cp. Scherer, pp. 275&ndash;76).
A biographical Dictionary of 1844 spoke of it as &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">cet ouvrage ampoul&eacute; qu&rsquo;on ne lit pas
aujourd&rsquo;hui.</span>&rdquo; Although the first edition (1770)
passed the censure only by means of bribery, and the second (1780) was
publicly burned, and its author forced to leave France, he was said to
reject, in religion, &ldquo;only the pope, hell, and monks&rdquo;
(Scherer, p. 286); and most of the anti-religious declamation in the
first edition of the <i lang="fr">Histoire</i> is said to be from the
pen of Diderot, who wrote it very much at random, at Raynal&rsquo;s
request.</p>

<p class="par">No list of orthodox names remotely comparable with these
can be drawn from the literature of France, or indeed of any other
country of that time. <span class="sc">Jean Jacques Rousseau</span>
(1712&ndash;1778), the one other pre-eminent figure, though not an
anti-Christian propagandist, is distinctly on the side of deism. In the

"pb255">255</a>]</span>writing with express approbation of Hobbes, he
declares that &ldquo;the Christian law is at bottom more injurious than
useful to the sound constitution of the State&rdquo;; and even the
famous <i>Confession of Faith of a Savoyard Vicar</i> in the <i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;mile</i> is anti-revelationist, and practically
anti-clerical. He was accordingly anathematized by the Sorbonne, which
found in <i lang="fr">&Eacute;mile</i> nineteen heresies; the book was
seized and burned both at Paris and at Geneva within a few weeks of its
appearance,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17088src" href="#xd21e17088"
name="xd21e17088src">121</a> and the author decreed to be arrested;
even the <i lang="fr">Contrat Social</i> was seized and its vendors
imprisoned. All the while he had maintained in <i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;mile</i> doctrines of the usefulness of religious delusion
and fanaticism. Still, although his temperamental way of regarding
things has a clear affinity with some later religious philosophy of a
more systematic sort, he undoubtedly made for freethought as well as
for the revolutionary spirit in general. Thus the cause of Christianity
stood almost denuded of intellectually eminent adherents in the France
of 1789; for even among the writers who had dealt with public questions
without discussing religion, or who had criticized Rousseau and the
<i lang="fr">philosophes</i>&mdash;as the Abb&eacute;s Mably, Morellet,
Millot&mdash;the tone was essentially rationalistic.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">It has been justly enough argued, concerning
Rousseau (see below, p. 287), that the generation of the Revolution
made him its prophet in his own despite, and that had he lived twenty
years longer he would have been its vehement adversary. But this does
not alter the facts as to his influence. A great writer of emotional
genius, like Rousseau, inevitably impels men beyond the range of his
own ideals, as in recent times Ruskin and Tolstoy, both
anti-Socialists, have led thousands towards Socialism. In his own
generation and the next, Rousseau counted essentially for criticism of
the existing order; and it was the revolutionaries, never the
conservatives, who acclaimed him. De Tocqueville (<i lang="fr">Hist.
philos. du r&egrave;gne de Louis XV</i>, 1849, i, 33) speaks of his
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">impi&eacute;t&eacute; dogmatique</span>.&rdquo;
Martin du Theil, in his <i lang="fr">J. J. Rousseau apologiste de la
religion chr&eacute;tienne</i> (2e &eacute;dit. 1840), makes out his
case by identifying emotional deism with Christianity, as did Rousseau
himself when he insisted that &ldquo;the true Christianity is only
natural religion well explained.&rdquo; Rousseau&rsquo;s praise of the
gospel and of the character of Jesus was such as many deists acquiesced
in. Similar language, in the mouth of Matthew Arnold, gave rather more
offence to Gladstone, as a believing Christian, than did the language
of simple unbelief; and a recent Christian polemist, at the close of a
copious monograph, has repudiated the association of Rousseau with the
faith (see J. F. Nourrisson, <i lang="fr">J. J. Rousseau et le
Rousseauisme</i>, 1903, p. 497 <i>sq.</i>). What is true of him is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>that he was more religiously a theist than
Voltaire, whose impeachment of Providence in the poem on the Earthquake
of Lisbon he sought strenuously though not very persuasively to refute
in a letter to the author. But, with all his manifold inconsistencies,
which may be worked down to the neurosis so painfully manifest in his
life and in his relations to his contemporaries, he never writes as a
believer in the dogmas of Christianity or in the principle of
revelation; and it was as a deist that he was recognized by his
Christian contemporaries. A demi-Christian is all that Michelet will
call him. His compatriot the Swiss pastor Roustan, located in London,
directed against him his <i lang="fr">Offrande aux Autels et &agrave;
la Patrie, ou D&eacute;fense du Christianisme</i> (1764), regarding him
as an assailant. The work of the Abb&eacute; Bergier, <i lang="fr">Le
D&eacute;isme refut&eacute; par lui-m&ecirc;me</i> (1765, and later),
takes the form of letters addressed to Rousseau, and is throughout an
attack on his works, especially the <i lang="fr">&Eacute;mile</i>.
When, therefore, Buckle (1-vol. ed. p. 475) speaks of him as not having
attacked Christianity, and Lord Morley (<i>Rousseau</i>, ch. xiv)
treats him as creating a religious reaction against the deists, they do
not fully represent his influence on his time. As we have seen, he
stimulated Voltaire to new audacities by his example.</p>

<p id="ch17.17" class="par">17. An interlude in the critical campaign,
little noticed at the time, developed importance a generation later. In
1753 <span class="sc">Jean Astruc</span>, doctor of medicine, published
after long hesitation his <i>Conjectures on the original documents
which Moses seems to have used in composing the book of Genesis</i>.
Only in respect of his flash of insight into the composite structure of
the Pentateuch was Astruc a freethinker. His hesitation to publish was
due to his fear that <i lang="fr">les pretendus esprits forts</i> might
make a bad use of his work; and he was quite satisfied that Moses was
the author of the Pentateuch as it stands. The denial of that
authorship, implied in the criticisms of Hobbes and Spinoza, he
described as &ldquo;the disease of the last century.&rdquo; This
attitude may explain the lack of interest in Astruc&rsquo;s work shown
by the freethinkers of the time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17146src"
href="#xd21e17146" name="xd21e17146src">122</a> Nonetheless, by his
perception of the clue given by the narrative use of the two names
Yahweh and Elohim in Genesis, he laid a new foundation of the Higher
Criticism of the Bible in modern times, advancing alike on Spinoza and
on Simon. For freethought he had &ldquo;builded better than he
knew.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=

Acad&eacute;mie, the intellectual movement of the age is as it were
dramatized; and there more clearly than in the literary record we can
trace the struggle of opinions, from the admission of Voltaire (1746)
onwards. In the old days the Acad&eacute;mie had been rather the home
of convention, royalism, and orthodoxy than of ideas, though before
Voltaire there were some freethinking members of the lesser
Acad&eacute;mies, notably Boindin.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17178src"

name="xd21e17184src">124</a> the atmosphere begins perceptibly to
change. When, in 1727, the academician Bonamy had read a memoir <i>On
the character and the paganism of the emperor Julian</i>, partly
vindicating him against the aspersions of the Christian Fathers, the
Academy feared to print the paper, though its author was a devout
Catholic.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17196src" href="#xd21e17196" name=

orthodox, read to the Academy portions of his <i lang="fr">Vie de
Julien</i>, the members were not now scandalized, though the
Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s Jansenism moved the King to veto his nomination.
So, when Blanchard in 1735 read a memoir on <i lang="fr">Les exorcismes
magiques</i> there was much trepidation among the members, and again
the Secretary inserted merely an analysis, concluding with the words of
Philetas, &ldquo;Believe and fear God; beware of

criticism as the challenging of the early history of Rome by
L&eacute;vesque de Pouilly (brother of L&eacute;vesque de Burigny) in a
dissertation before the Acad&eacute;mie in 1722, roused the fears and
the resentment of the orthodox; the Abb&eacute; Sallier, in undertaking
to refute him, insinuated that he had shown a spirit which might be
dangerous to other beliefs; and whispers of atheism passed among the
academicians.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17214src" href="#xd21e17214"

stock; his book was published, under his initials, at Utrecht; and not
till 1753 did the Acad&eacute;mie award him a medal&mdash;on the score
of an earlier treatise. And in 1748 the <i lang="la">Religio veterum

Mongault, tutor of the son of the Regent, and noted alike for his

can be seen passing away. D&rsquo;Argenson notes in his diary in 1754:
&ldquo;I observe in the Acad&eacute;mie de belles-lettres, of which I
am a member, that there begins to be a decided stir against the
priests. It began to show itself at the death of Boindin, to whom our
bigots refused a service at the Oratory and a public commemoration. Our
deist philosophers were shocked, and ever since, at each election, they
are on guard against the priests and the bigots. Nowhere is this
division so marked, and it begins to bear fruits.&rdquo;<a class=

whole world.&rdquo; It was in this year that D&rsquo;Alembert, who took

<p id="ch17.19" class="par">19. In 1759 there came a check. The
<i lang="fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i>, which had been allowed to resume
publication after its first suppression in 1752, was again stopped; and
the battle between <i lang="fr">philosophes</i> and fanatics,
dramatized for the time being in Palissot&rsquo;s comedy <i lang=
"fr">Les Philosophes</i> and in Voltaire&rsquo;s rejoinder to
Fr&eacute;ron, <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;&Eacute;cossaise</i>, came to be
fought out in the Academy itself. The poet Lefranc de
Pompignan,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17284src" href="#xd21e17284"
name="xd21e17284src">134</a> elected in 1759 without any opposition
from the freethinkers, had in his youth translated Pope&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Deist&rsquo;s Prayer,&rdquo; and had suffered for it to the
extent of being deprived by D&rsquo;Aguesseau of <span class=

official charge<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17290src" href="#xd21e17290"
name="xd21e17290src">135</a> for six months. With such a past, with a
keen concern for status, and with a character that did not stick at
tergiversation, Pompignan saw fit to signalize his election by making
his <i lang="fr">discours de r&eacute;ception</i> (March, 1760) a
violent attack on the whole philosophic school, which, in his
conclusion, he declared to be undermining &ldquo;equally the throne and
the altar.&rdquo; The academicians heard him out in perfect silence,
leaving it to the few pietists among the audience to applaud; but as
soon as the reports reached Ferney there began the vengeance of
Voltaire. First came a leaflet of stinging sentences, each beginning
with <i lang="fr">Quand</i>: &ldquo;<i>When</i> one has translated and
even exaggerated the &lsquo;Deist&rsquo;s Prayer&rsquo; composed by
Pope ...,&rdquo; and so on. The maddened Pompignan addressed a fatuous
memorial to the King (who notoriously hated the <i lang=
"fr">philosophes</i>, and had assented only under petticoat influence
to Voltaire&rsquo;s election<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17306src" href=
"#xd21e17306" name="xd21e17306src">136</a>); and, presuming to print it
without the usual official sanction, suffered at the hands of
Malesherbes the blow of having the printer&rsquo;s plant smashed. Other
combatants entered the fray. Voltaire&rsquo;s leaflet &ldquo;les
<i lang="fr">quand</i>&rdquo; was followed by &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">les <i>si</i>, les <i>pour</i>, les <i>qui</i>, les <i>quoi</i>,
les <i>car</i>, les <i>ah</i>!</span>&rdquo;&mdash;by him or

satires in verse,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17334src" href=
"#xd21e17334" name="xd21e17334src">137</a> all accompanied by murderous
prose annotations. The speedy result was Pompignan&rsquo;s retirement
into provincial life. He could not face the merciless hail of
rejoinders; and when at his death, twenty-five years later, the
Abb&eacute; Maury had to pronounce his <i lang="fr">&eacute;loge</i>,

fiction, the ecclesiastics of the old school being still too thoroughly
steeped in the past to realize that a gospel of persecution was a bad
warcry for a religion that was being more and more put on the
defensive. Only an angry fear before the rising flood of unlicensed
literature, combining with the long-baffled desire to strike some blow
at freethinking, could have moved the Sorbonne to select for censure
the duly licensed work<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17378src" href=

novelist; and it should be remembered that it was at a time of great
activity in the unlicensed production of freethinking literature that
the attack was made. The blow recoiled signally. The book was of course
promptly translated into all the languages of Europe, selling by tens
of thousands;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17384src" href="#xd21e17384"
name="xd21e17384src">143</a> and two sovereigns took occasion to give
it their express approval. These were the Empress Catherine (who caused
the book to be translated by members of her court while she was making
a tour of her empire, she herself taking a chapter), and the Empress
Maria-Theresa. From Catherine, herself a freethinker, the approbation
might have been expected; but the known orthodoxy and austerity of
Maria-Theresa made her support the more telling. In France a small
literary tempest raged for a year. Marmontel published his
correspondence with the syndic of the Sorbonne and with Voltaire; and
in all there appeared some dozen documents <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>,
among them an anonymous satire by Turgot, <i lang="fr">Les xxxvii
verit&eacute;s oppos&eacute;es aux xxxvii impi&eacute;t&eacute;s de

battle.</p>
<p id="ch17.21" class="par">21. Alongside of the more strictly literary
or humanist movement, too, there went on one of a scientific kind,
which divided into two lines, a speculative and a practical. On the
former the freelance philosopher <span class="sc">Julien Offray la
Mettrie</span> gave a powerful initial push by his materialistic
theses, in which a medical knowledge that for the time was advanced is
applied with a very keen if unsystematic reasoning faculty to the
primary problem of mind and body; and others after him continued the
impulse. La Mettrie produced his <i>Natural History of the Mind</i> in
1745;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17420src" href="#xd21e17420" name=

on the Origin of Human Knowledge</i> of the Abb&eacute; <span class=
"sc">Condillac</span>, both essentially rationalistic and
anti-theological works, though differing in their psychological
positions, Condillac being a non-materialist, though a strong upholder
of &ldquo;sensism.&rdquo; La Mettrie followed up his doctrine with the
more definitely materialistic but less heedfully planned works,
<i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Homme Plante</i> and <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Homme
Machine</i> (1748), the second of which, published at Leyden<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17447src" href="#xd21e17447" name=
"xd21e17447src">146</a> and wickedly dedicated to the pious Baron von
Haller, was burned by order of the magistrates, its author being at the
same time expelled from Holland. Both books are remarkable for their
originality of thought, biological and ethical. Though La Mettrie
professed to think the &ldquo;greatest degree of probability&rdquo; was
in favour of the existence of a personal God,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e17456src" href="#xd21e17456" name="xd21e17456src">147</a> his
other writings gave small support to the hypothesis; and even in
putting it he rejects any inference as to worship. And he goes on to
quote very placidly an atheist who insists that only an atheistic world
can attain to happiness. It is notable that he, the typical materialist
of his age, seems to have been one of its kindliest men, by the consent
of all who knew him,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17464src" href=

bravado.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The conventional denunciation of La Mettrie
(endorsed by Lord Morley, <i>Voltaire</i>, p. 122) proceeds ostensibly
upon those of his writings in which he discussed sexual questions with
absolute scientific freedom. He, however, insisted that his theoretic
discussion had nothing whatever to do with his practice; and there is
no evidence that he lived otherwise than as most men did in his age,
and ours. Still, the severe censure passed on him by Diderot (<i lang=
"fr">Essai sur les r&egrave;gnes de Claude et de N&eacute;ron</i>, ed.
1782, ii, 22&ndash;24) seems to convict him of at least levity of
character. Voltaire several times holds the same tone. But Diderot
writes so angrily that his verdict incurs suspicion.</p>
<p class="par">As Lange notes, there has been much loose generalization
as to the place and bearing of La Mettrie in the history of French
thought. Hettner, who apparently had not thought it worth while to read
him, has ascribed his mental movement to the influence of
Diderot&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es philosophiques</i> (1746),
whereas it had begun in his own <i lang="fr">Histoire naturelle de
l&rsquo;&acirc;me</i>, published a year before. La Mettrie&rsquo;s
originality and influence in general <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>have been
underestimated as a result of the hostility set up by disparagement of
his character. The idea of a fundamental unity of type in
nature&mdash;an idea underlying all the successive steps of Lamarck,
Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Goethe, and others, towards the complete
conception of evolution&mdash;is set forth by him in <i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;Homme Plante</i> in 1748, the year in which appeared De
Maillet&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Telliamed</i>. Buffon follows in time as
in thought, only beginning his great work in 1749; Maupertuis, with his
pseudonymous dissertation on the <i>Universal system of Nature</i>,
applies La Mettrie&rsquo;s conception in 1751; and Diderot&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es sur l&rsquo;interpr&eacute;tation de la
nature</i>, stimulated by Maupertuis, appeared only in 1754. La Mettrie
proceeded from the classification of Linn&aelig;us, but did not there
find his idea. In the words of Lange, &ldquo;these forgotten writings
are in nowise so empty and superficial as is commonly assumed.&rdquo;
<i lang="de">Gesch. des Materialismus</i>, i, 328&ndash;29. Lange seems
to have been the first to make a judicial study of La Mettrie&rsquo;s
work, as distinguished from the scandals about his character.</p>

publication of Fontenelle&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Entretiens</i>, and
thenceforward it rapidly strengthens. Barren theological disputations
set men not merely against theology, but upon the study of Nature,
where real knowledge was visibly possible. To a certain extent the
study took openly heretical lines. The Abb&eacute; Lenglet du Fresnoy,
who was four times imprisoned in the Bastille, supplied material of
which D&rsquo;Argens made much use, tending to overthrow the Biblical
chronology and to discredit the story of the Flood.<a class="noteref"

Beno&icirc;t de Maillet (1656&ndash;1738), who had been for fifteen
years inspector of the French establishments in Egypt and Barbary, left
for posthumous publication (1748) a work of which the first title was
an anagram of his name, <i lang="fr">Telliamed, ou Entretiens
d&rsquo;un philosophe indien avec un missionaire fran&ccedil;ais</i>.
Of this treatise the thesis is that the shell deposits in the Alps and
elsewhere showed the sea to have been where land now was; and that the
rocks were gradually deposited in their different kinds in the fashion
in which even now are being formed mud, sand, and shingle. De Maillet
had thus anticipated the central conception of modern geology, albeit
retaining many traditional delusions. His abstention from publication
during his lifetime testifies to his sense of the danger he underwent,
the treatise having been printed by him only in 1735, at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>age of seventy-nine; and not till ten years
after his death was it given to the world, with &ldquo;a preface and
dedication so worded as, in case of necessity, to give the printer a
fair chance of falling back on the excuse that the work was intended
for a mere <i lang="fr">jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>.&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="par">The thesis was adopted, indeed plagiarized,<a class=

possible deposit of shells by pilgrims.<a class="noteref" id=

not unlikely that it was Voltaire&rsquo;s opposition rather than any
orthodox argumentation that retarded in France the acceptance of an
evolutionary view of the origin of the earth and of life. It probably
had a more practical effect on scientific thought in England<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17572src" href="#xd21e17572" name=
"xd21e17572src">153</a>&mdash;at least as regards geology: its
speculations on the modification of species, which loosely but
noticeably anticipate some of the inferences of Darwin, found no
acceptance anywhere till Lamarck. In the opinion of Huxley, the
speculations of Robinet, in the next generation, &ldquo;are rather
behind than in advance of those of De Maillet&rdquo;;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e17575src" href="#xd21e17575" name="xd21e17575src">154</a> and
it may be added that the former, with his pet theory that all Nature is
&ldquo;animated,&rdquo; and that the stars and planets have the faculty
of reproducing themselves like animals, wandered as far from sound
bases as De Maillet ever did. The very form of De Maillet&rsquo;s work,
indeed, was not favourable to its serious acceptance; and in his case,
as in those of so many pioneers of new ideas, errors and extravagances
and oversights in regard to matters of detail went to justify
&ldquo;practical&rdquo; men in dismissing novel speculations. Needless
to say, the common run of scientific men remained largely under the
influence of religious presuppositions in science even when they had
turned their backs on the Church. Nonetheless, on all sides the study
of natural fact began to play its part in breaking down the dominion of
creed. Even in hidebound Protestant Switzerland, the sheer ennui of
Puritanism is seen driving the descendants of the Huguenot refugees to
the physical sciences for an interest and an occupation, before any
freethinking can safely be avowed; and in France, as Buckle has shown
in abundant detail, the study of the physical sciences became for many
years before the Revolution almost a fashionable mania. And at the
start the Church had contrived that such study should rank as unbelief,
and so make unbelievers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href=

most readers by its finished style was paralleled by the wrath which
its <i lang="fr">Th&eacute;orie de la Terre</i> aroused among the

Sorbonne an official letter specifying as reprehensible in his book
fourteen propositions which he was invited to retract. He stoically
obeyed in a declaration to the effect that he had &ldquo;no intention
to contradict the text of Scripture,&rdquo; and that he believed
&ldquo;most firmly all there related about the creation,&rdquo; adding:

oppression. For all such insults, and for the long roll of her

<p id="ch17.23" class="par">23. But science, like theology, had its
schisms, and the rationalizing camp had its own strifes. <span class=

the victims of the mockery of Voltaire (which he well earned by his own

d&rsquo;Holbach under the same title) he in 1751 propounded a new
version of the hylozoisms of ancient Greece; developed the idea of an
underlying unity in the forms of natural life, already propounded by La
Mettrie in his <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Homme Plante</i>; connected it with
Leibnitz&rsquo;s formula of the economy of nature (&ldquo;minimum of

the physio-psychological conception of man as an &ldquo;animated

of bacterial life; but he seems to have had more deriders than
disciples. He founds at once on Descartes and on Leibnitz, but in his

against such detraction it is fitting to note that Helv&eacute;tius,
like La Mettrie, was one of the most lovable and most beloved men of
his time, though, like him, sufficiently licentious in his youth.</p>

critical wisdom, and it definitely and seriously founds public ethics
on utility. Its most serious error, the assumption that all men are
born with equal faculties, and that education is the sole
differentiating force, was repeated in our own age by John Stuart Mill;
but in Helv&eacute;tius the error is balanced by the thoroughly sound
and profoundly important thesis that the general superiorities of

politics.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17760src" href="#xd21e17760" name=

be claimed for the teachings of the whole of the orthodox moralists of
the age. For the rest, Helv&eacute;tius is not to be ranked among the
great abstract thinkers; but it is noteworthy that his thinking went on
advancing to the end. Always greatly influenced by Voltaire, he did not
philosophically harden as did his master; and though in his posthumous
work, <i lang="fr">Les Progr&egrave;s de la Raison dans la recherche du
Vrai</i> (published in 1775), he stands for deism against atheism, the
argument ends in the pantheism to which Voltaire had once attained, but
did not adhere.</p>
<p id="ch17.24" class="par">24. Over all of these men, and even in some
measure over Voltaire, <span class="sc">Diderot</span>
(1713&ndash;1784) stands pre-eminent, on retrospect, for variety of
power and depth and subtlety of thought; though for these very reasons,
as well as because some of his most masterly works were never printed
in his lifetime, he was less of a recognized popular force than some of
his friends. In his own mental history he reproduces the course of the
French thought of his time. Beginning as a deist, he assailed the
contemporary materialists; in the end, with whatever of inconsistency,
he was emphatically an atheist and a materialist. One of his most
intimate friends was Damilaville, of whom Voltaire speaks as a vehement
anti-theist;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17802src" href="#xd21e17802"

<p class="par first">Compare, as to Diderot&rsquo;s position,
Soury&rsquo;s contention (p. 577) that we shall never make an atheist
and a materialist out of &ldquo;this enthusiastic artist, this
poet-pantheist&rdquo; (citing Rosenkranz in support), with his own
admissions, pp. 589&ndash;90, and with Lord Morley&rsquo;s remarks, pp.
33, 401, 418. See also Lange, i, 310 <i>sq.</i>; ii, 63 (Eng. tr. ii,
32, 256). In the affectionate <i lang="fr">&eacute;loge</i> of his
friend Meister (1786) there is an express avowal that &ldquo;it had
been much to be desired for the reputation of Diderot, perhaps even for
the honour of his age, that he had not been an atheist, or that he had
been so with less zeal.&rdquo; The fact is thus put beyond reasonable
doubt. In the <i lang="fr">Correspondance Litt&eacute;raire</i> of
Grimm and Diderot, under date September 15, 1765 (vii, 366), there is a
letter in criticism of Descartes, thoroughly atheistic in its
reasoning, which is almost certainly by Diderot. And if the criticism
of Voltaire&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Dieu</i>, above referred to (p. 231),
be not by him, he was certainly in entire agreement with it, as with
Grimm in general. Rosenkranz <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href=

&ldquo;<span lang="de">Diderot war als Atheist Pantheist</span>,&rdquo;
which is merely a way of saying that he was scientifically monistic in
his atheism. Lange points out in this connection (i, 310) that the
Hegelian schema of philosophic evolution, &ldquo;with its sovereign
contempt for chronology,&rdquo; has wrought much confusion as to the
real developments of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It is recorded that Diderot&rsquo;s own last words in
serious conversation were: &ldquo;The beginning of philosophy is

<i>Inquiry concerning Virtue and Merit</i>; and he must have read with
prompt appreciation the other English freethinkers then famous. Ere
long, however, he had risen above the deistical plane of thought, and
grappled with the fundamental issues which the deists took for granted,
partly because of an innate bent to psychological analysis, partly
because he was more interested in scientific problems than in scholarly
research. The <i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es philosophiques</i>, published
in 1746, really deserve their name; and though they exhibit him as

<p class="par">But Diderot was not the kind of man to be silenced by
menaces. In the famous Sorbonne thesis of the Abb&eacute; de Prades

was condemned and deprived of his licence (1752) Diderot wrote the
third part of the <i lang="fr">Apologie</i> (published by De Prades in

other parts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17910src" href="#xd21e17910"

have translated when at his seminary, seeking there the antidote to the
poison of the deists. The entire handling of the question of pagan and
Christian miracles, too, suggests the skilled dialectician, though it
is substantially an adaptation of Leslie&rsquo;s <i>Short and Easy
Method with the Deists</i>. The alternate eulogy and criticism of Locke
are likely to be his, as is indeed the abundant knowledge of English

official prosecution of that and of others of his works&mdash;and his
misdeeds in the way of indecent fiction. When organized society is made
to figure as the heartless enemy of thinking men, it is no great wonder
if they are careless at times about the effect of their writings on
society. But it stands to his lasting honour that his sufferings at the

were base enough to beg of him. It seems no exaggeration to say that
the bulk of his life was given to helping other people; and the
indirect effect of his work, which is rather intellectually
disinterested than didactic, is no less liberative and humanitarian.

treatises from the German; and his still longer series of original

a dispassionate philosophic research, its polemic against human folly
laid it open to the regulation retort that on its own necessarian
principles no such polemic was admissible. That retort is, of course,
ultimately invalid when the denunciation is resolved into
demonstration. If, however, it be termed &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; on the

to the Christian Fathers, to Pascal, Milton, Carlyle, Ruskin, and a

is really emotional rather than philosophic, and hortatory rather than
scientific; and it was all the more influential on that account. To the
sensation it produced is to be ascribed the edict of 1770 condemning a
whole shelf of previous works to be burnt along with it by the common
hangman.</p>
<p id="ch17.26" class="par">26. The death of d&rsquo;Holbach (1789)
brings us to the French Revolution. By that time all the great
freethinking propagandists and non-combatant deists of the Voltairean
group were gone, save <span class="sc">Condorcet</span>. Voltaire and
Rousseau had died in 1778, Helv&eacute;tius in 1771, Turgot in 1781,
D&rsquo;Alembert in 1783, Diderot in 1784. After all their labours,
only the educated minority, broadly speaking, had been made
freethinkers; and of these, despite the vogue of the <i>System of
Nature</i>, only a minority were atheists. Deism prevailed, as we have
seen, among the foremost revolutionists; but atheism was relatively
rare. Voltaire, indeed, impressed by the number of cultured men of his
acquaintance who avowed it, latterly speaks<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18184src" href="#xd21e18184" name="xd21e18184src">207</a> of them
as very numerous; and Grimm must have had a good many among the
subscribers to his correspondence, to permit of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>penning or passing the atheistic criticism there
given of Voltaire&rsquo;s first reply to d&rsquo;Holbach. Nevertheless,
there was no continuous atheistic movement; and after 1789 the new
freethinking works run to critical and ethical attack on the Christian
system rather than on theism. <span class="sc">Volney</span> combined
both lines of attack in his famous <i>Ruins of Empires</i> (1791); and
the learned <span class="sc">Dupuis</span>, in his voluminous <i>Origin
of all Cults</i> (1795), took an important step, not yet fully reckoned
with by later mythologists, towards the mythological analysis of the
gospel narrative. After these vigorous performances, the popular
progress of French freethought was for long practically
suspended<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18223src" href="#xd21e18223" name=
"xd21e18223src">208</a> by the tumult of the Revolution and the
reaction which followed it, though <span class="sc">Laplace</span> went
on his way with his epoch-making theory of the origin of the solar
system, for which, as he told Napoleon, he had &ldquo;no need of the
hypothesis&rdquo; of a God. The admirable <span class=
"sc">Condorcet</span> had died, perhaps by his own hand, in 1794, when
in hiding from the Terrorists, leaving behind him his <i lang=

l&rsquo;esprit humain</i>, in which the most sanguine convictions of
the rationalistic school are reformulated without a trace of bitterness
or of despair.</p>

has been more distorted than that at which it is embroiled in the
French Revolution. The conventional view in England still is that the
Revolution was the work of deists and atheists, but chiefly of the
latter; that they suppressed Christianity and set up a worship of a
Goddess of Reason, represented by a woman of the town; and that the
bloodshed of the Terror represented the application of their principles
to government, or at least the political result of the withdrawal of
religious checks.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18244src" href=

from Charlemagne onwards; the story of the Crusades, in which nine
millions of human beings are estimated to have been destroyed; the

Spaniards in the name of the Cross&mdash;those who recall these things

<p class="par">(<i>a</i>) That many of the leading men among the

a number of these the normal attitude was represented in the work of
Necker, <i lang="fr">Sur l&rsquo;importance des id&eacute;es

<p class="par">(<i>b</i>) An &agrave; priori method has served alike in
freethinkers&rsquo; and in pietists&rsquo; hands to obscure the facts.
When Michelet insists on the &ldquo;irreconcilable opposition of
Christianity to the Revolution&rdquo;&mdash;a thesis in which he was
heartily supported by Proudhon<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18393src"
href="#xd21e18393" name="xd21e18393src">223</a>&mdash;he means that the
central Christian dogmas of salvation by sacrifice and faith exclude
any political ethic of justice<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18402src"
href="#xd21e18402" name="xd21e18402src">224</a>&mdash;any doctrine of
equality and equity. But this is only to say that Christianity as an
organization is in perpetual contradiction with some main part of its
professed creed; and that has been a commonplace since Constantine. It
does not mean that either Christians in multitudes or their churches as
organizations have not constantly proceeded on ordinary political
motives, whether populist or anti-populist. In Germany we have seen
Lutheranism first fomenting and afterwards repudiating the movement of
the peasants for betterment; and in England in the next century both
parties in the civil war invoke religious doctrines, meeting texts with
texts. Jansenism was in constant friction with the monarchy from its
outset; and Louis XIV and Louis XV alike regarded the Jansenists as the
enemies of the throne. &ldquo;Christianity&rdquo; could be as easily
&ldquo;reconciled&rdquo; with a democratic movement in the last quarter
of the eighteenth century as with the Massacre of Saint
Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day in the sixteenth. If those Christians who still
charge &ldquo;the bloodshed of the French Revolution&rdquo; on the
spirit of incredulity desire to corroborate Michelet to the extent of
making Christianity the bulwark of absolute monarchy, the friend of a
cruel feudalism, and the guardian genius of the Bastille, they may be
left to the criticism of their fellow-believers who have embraced the
newer principle that the truth of the Christian religion is to be
proved by connecting it in practice with the spirit of social reform.
To point out to either party, as did Michelet, that <i>evangelical</i>
Christianity is a religion of submission and preparation for the end of
all things, and has nothing to do with rational political reform,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>is to bestow logic where logic is
indomiciliable. While rationalism undoubtedly fosters the critical
spirit, professed Christians have during many ages shown themselves as
prone to rebellion as to war, whether on religious or on political
pretexts.</p>
<p class="par">(<i>c</i>) For the rest, the legend falsifies what took
place. The facts are now established by exact documentary research. The
Government never substituted any species of religion for the
Catholic.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18418src" href="#xd21e18418" name=

Throughout, the devoutly theistic Rousseau was the chief literary hero
of the movement. The two executive Committees in no way countenanced
the dechristianization of the Churches, but on the contrary imprisoned
persons who removed church properties; and these in turn protested that
they had no thought of abolishing religion. The acts of irresponsible
violence did not amount to a hundredth part of the
&ldquo;sacrilege&rdquo; wrought in Protestant countries at the
Reformation, and do not compare with the acts charged on
Cromwell&rsquo;s troopers. The policy of inviting priests and bishops
to abdicate their functions was strictly political; and the Archbishop
Gobel did <i>not</i> abjure Catholicism, but only surrendered his
office. That a number of priests did gratuitously abjure their religion
is only a proof of what was well known&mdash;that a good many priests
were simple deists. We have seen how many abb&eacute;s fought in the
freethought ranks, or near them. Diderot in a letter of 1769 tells of a
day which he and a friend had passed with two monks who were atheists.
&ldquo;One of them read the first draft of a very fresh and very
vigorous treatise on atheism, full of new and bold ideas; I learned
with edification that this doctrine was the current doctrine of their
cloisters. For the rest, these two monks were the &lsquo;big
bonnets&rsquo; of their monastery; they had intellect, gaiety, good
feeling, knowledge.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18433src" href=

hostile to the movement; in his character of Rousseauist and deist he
argued that atheism was &ldquo;aristocratic&rdquo;; he put to death the
leaders of the Cult of Reason; and he set up the Worship of the Supreme
Being as a counter-move. Broadly speaking, he affiliated to Necker, and
stood very much at the standpoint of the English Unitarianism of the
present day. Thus the bloodshed of the Reign of Terror, if it is to be
charged on any species of philosophic doctrine rather than on the
unscrupulous policy of the enemies of the Revolution in and out of
France, stands to the credit of the belief in a God, the creed of
Frederick, Turgot, Necker, Franklin, Pitt, and Washington. The one

the Cult of Reason with sound and serious and persuasive argument, and
strongly blamed all forcible interference with worship, while at the

atheism had not come, any more than the triumph of Reason.</p>

<p id="ch17.28" class="par">28. The anti-atheistic and anti-philosophic
legend was born of the exasperation and bad faith of the dethroned
aristocracy, themselves often unbelievers in the day of their
ascendancy, and, whether unbelievers or not, responsible with the
Church and the court for that long insensate resistance to reform which
made the revolution inevitable. Mere random denunciation of new ideas
as tending to generate rebellion was of course an ancient commonplace.
Medieval heretics had been so denounced; Wiclif was in his day; and
when the Count de Cataneo attacked Montesquieu&rsquo;s <i>Spirit of
Laws</i>, he spoke of all such reasonings as &ldquo;attempts which
shake the sacred basis of thrones.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18505src" href="#xd21e18505" name="xd21e18505src">233</a> But he
and his contemporaries knew that freethinkers were not specially given
to mutiny; and when, later, French Churchmen had begun systematically
to accuse the philosophers of undermining alike the Church and the
throne,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18510src" href="#xd21e18510" name=
"xd21e18510src">234</a> the unbelieving nobles, conscious of entire
political conservatism, had simply laughed. Better than anyone else
they knew that political revolt had other roots and motives than
incredulity; and they could not but remember how many French kings had
been rebelled against by the Church, and how many slain by priestly
hands. Their acceptance of the priestly formula came later. In the life
of the brilliant Rivarol, who associated with the noblesse while
disdained by many of them because of his obscure birth, we may read the
intellectual history of the case. Brilliant without patience, keen
without scientific coherence,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18539src"
href="#xd21e18539" name="xd21e18539src">235</a> Rivarol in 1787 met the
pious deism of Necker with a dialectic in which cynicism as often
disorders as illuminates the argument. With prompt veracity he first
rejects the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>ideal of a beneficent reign of delusion, and
insists that religion is seen in all history powerless alike to
overrule men&rsquo;s passions and prejudices, and to console the
oppressed by its promise of a reversal of earthly conditions in another
world. But in the same breath, by way of proving that the atheist is
less disturbing to convention than the deist, he insists that the
unbeliever soon learns to see that &ldquo;irreverences are crimes
against society&rdquo;; and then, in order to justify such conformity,
asserts what he had before denied. And the self-contradiction
recurs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18548src" href="#xd21e18548" name=
"xd21e18548src">236</a> The underlying motive of the whole polemic is
simply the grudge of the upper class diner-out against the serious and
conscientious <i lang="fr">bourgeois</i> who strives to reform the
existing system. Conscious of being more enlightened, the wit is eager
at once to disparage Necker for his religiosity and to discredit him
politically as the enemy of the socially useful ecclesiastical order.
Yet in his second letter <i lang="fr">Sur la morale</i> (1788) he is so
plainly an unbeliever that the treatise had to be printed at Berlin.
The due sequence is that when the Revolution breaks out Rivarol sides
with the court and the noblesse, while perfectly aware of the
ineptitude and malfeasance of both;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18559src" href="#xd21e18559" name="xd21e18559src">237</a> and,
living in exile, proceeds to denounce the philosophers as having caused
the overturn by their universal criticism. In 1787 he had declared that
he would not even have written his Letters to Necker if he were not
certain that &ldquo;the people does not read.&rdquo; Then the people
had read neither the philosophers nor him. But in exile he must needs
frame for the <i lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> a formula, true or
false. It is the falsity of men divided against themselves, who pay
themselves with recriminations rather than realize their own
deserts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18571src" href="#xd21e18571" name=

<p id="ch17.29" class="par">29. If any careful attempt be made to
analyse the situation, the stirring example of the precedent revolution
in the British American colonies will probably be recognized as
counting for very much more than any merely literary influence in
promoting that of France. A certain &ldquo;republican&rdquo; spirit had
indeed existed among educated men in France throughout the reign of
Louis XV: D&rsquo;Argenson noted it in 1750 and later.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18579src" href="#xd21e18579" name=

"xd21e18584src">240</a> was simply the spirit of
<i>constitutionalism</i>, the love of law and good government, and it
derived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=

Englishmen as Locke,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18594src" href=
"#xd21e18594" name="xd21e18594src">241</a> insofar as it was not
spontaneous. If acceptance of the doctrine of constitutional government
can lead to anarchy, let it be avowed; but let not the cause be
pretended to be deism or atheism. The political teaching for which the
Paris Parlement denounced Rousseau&rsquo;s <i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;mile</i> in 1762, and for which the theologians of the
Sorbonne censured Marmontel&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">B&eacute;lisaire</i>
in 1767, was the old doctrine of the sovereignty of the people. But
this had been maintained by a whole school of English Protestant
Christians before Bossuet denounced the Protestant Jurieu for
maintaining it. Nay, it had been repeatedly maintained by Catholic
theologians, from Thomas Aquinas to Suarez,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18622src" href="#xd21e18622" name="xd21e18622src">242</a>
especially when there was any question of putting down a Protestant
monarch. Protestants on their part protested indignantly, and
reciprocated. The recriminations of Protestants and Catholics on this
head form one of the standing farces of human history. Coger, attacking
Marmontel, unctuously cites Bayle&rsquo;s censure of his fellow
Protestants in his <i lang="fr">Avis aux
R&eacute;fugi&eacute;z</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e18630src" href=
"#xd21e18630" name="xd21e18630src">243</a> for their tone towards kings
and monarchy, but says nothing of Bayle&rsquo;s quarrel with Jurieu,
which motived such an utterance, or of his <i lang="fr">Critique
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> of Maimbourg&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Histoire
du Calvinisme</i>, in which he shows how the Catholic historian&rsquo;s
principles would justify the rebellion alike of Catholics in every
Protestant country and of Protestants in every Catholic
country,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18644src" href="#xd21e18644" name=
"xd21e18644src">244</a> though all the while it is assumed that true
Christians never resort to violence. And, unless there has been an
error as to his authorship, Bayle himself, be it remembered, had in his
letter <i lang="fr">Ce que c&rsquo;est que la France toute catholique
sous le r&egrave;gne de Louis le Grand</i> passed as scathing a
criticism on Louis XIV as any Protestant refugee could well have
compassed. Sectarian hypocrisies apart, the doctrine of the sovereignty
of the people&mdash;for opposing which the freethinker Hobbes has been
execrated by generations of Christians&mdash;is the professed political
creed of the very classes who, in England and the United States, have
so long denounced French freethinkers for an alleged
&ldquo;subversive&rdquo; social teaching which fell far short of what
English and American Protestants had actually practised. The revolt of
the American colonies, in fact, precipitated democratic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>feeling in France in a way that no writing had
ever done. Lafayette, no freethinker, declared himself republican at
once on reading the American declaration of the Rights of Man.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18658src" href="#xd21e18658" name=
"xd21e18658src">245</a> In all this the freethinking propaganda counted
for nothing directly and for little indirectly, inasmuch as there was
no clerical quarrel in the colonies. And if we seek for even an
indirect or general influence, apart from the affirmation of the duty
of kings to their people, the thesis as to the activity of the <i lang=
"fr">philosophes</i> must at once be restricted to the cases of
Rousseau, Helv&eacute;tius, Raynal, and d&rsquo;Holbach, for Marmontel
never passed beyond &ldquo;sound&rdquo; generalities.</p>
<p class="par">As for the pretence that it was freethinking doctrines
that brought Louis XVI to the scaffold, it is either the most impudent
or the most ignorant of historical imputations. The &ldquo;right&rdquo;
of tyrannicide had been maintained by Catholic schoolmen before the
Reformation, and by both Protestants and Catholics afterwards, times
without number, even as they maintained the right of the people to
depose and change kings. The doctrine was in fact not even a modern
innovation, the theory being so well primed by the practice&mdash;under
every sort of government, Jewish and pagan in antiquity, Moslem in the
Middle Ages, and Christian from the day of Pepin to the day of John
Knox&mdash;that a certain novelty lay on the side of the &ldquo;divine
right of kings&rdquo; when that was popularly formulated. And on the
whole question of revolution, or the right of peoples to recast their
laws, the general doctrine of the most advanced of the French
freethinkers is paralleled or outgone by popes and Church Councils in
the Middle Ages, by Occam and Marsiglio of Padua and Wiclif and more
than one German legist in the fourteenth century, by John Major and
George Buchanan in Scotland, by Goodman in England, and by many
Huguenots in France, in the sixteenth; by Hotman in his <i lang=
"fr">Francogallia</i> in 1574; by the author of the <i lang=
"fr">Soupirs de la France Esclave</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18674src" href="#xd21e18674" name="xd21e18674src">246</a> in
1689; and by the whole propagandist literature of the English and
American Revolutions in the seventeenth and eighteenth. So far from
being a specialty of freethinkers, &ldquo;sedition&rdquo; was in all
these and other cases habitually grounded on Biblical texts and
religious protestations; so that Bacon, little given as he was to
defending rationalists, could confidently avow that &ldquo;Atheism
leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to
reputation ... but superstition dismounts all these, and erecteth an
absolute monarchy in the minds of men. Therefore atheism did never
perturb states.... <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284"
name="pb284">284</a>]</span>But superstition hath been the confusion of
many states.&rdquo; For &ldquo;superstition&rdquo; read
&ldquo;sectarianism,&rdquo; &ldquo;fanaticism,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;ecclesiasticism.&rdquo; Bacon&rsquo;s generalization is of
course merely empirical, atheism being capable of alliance with
revolutionary passion in its turn; but the historical summary holds
good. Only by men who had not read or had forgotten universal history
could the ascription of the French Revolution to rationalistic thought
have been made.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18679src" href="#xd21e18679"
name="xd21e18679src">247</a></p>
<p id="ch17.30" class="par">30. A survey of the work and attitude of
the leading French freethinkers of the century may serve to settle the
point once for all. Voltaire is admittedly out of the question. Mallet
du Pan, whose resistance to the Revolution developed into a fanaticism
hardly less perturbing to judgment<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18692src"
href="#xd21e18692" name="xd21e18692src">248</a> than that of Burke,
expressly disparaged him as having so repelled men by his cynicism that
he had little influence on their feelings, and so could not be reckoned
a prime force in preparing the Revolution.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18704src" href="#xd21e18704" name="xd21e18704src">249</a>
&ldquo;Mably,&rdquo; the critic adds, &ldquo;whose republican
declamations have intoxicated many modern democrats, was religious to
austerity: at the first stroke of the tocsin against the Church of
Rome, he would have thrown his books in the fire, excepting his
scathing apostrophes to Voltaire and the atheists. Marmontel,
Saint-Lambert, Morellet, Encyclopedists, were adversaries of the
revolution.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18713src" href=
"#xd21e18713" name="xd21e18713src">250</a> On the other hand, Barante
avows that Mably, detesting as he did the freethinking philosophers of
his day, followed no less than others &ldquo;a destructive course, and
contributed, without knowing it, to weaken the already frayed ties
which still united the parts of an ancient society.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18718src" href="#xd21e18718" name=
"xd21e18718src">251</a> As Barante had previously ascribed the whole
dissolution to the autocratic process under Louis XIV,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18723src" href="#xd21e18723" name=
"xd21e18723src">252</a> even this indictment of the orthodox Mably is
invalid. Voltaire, on the other hand, Barante charges with an undue
leaning to the methods of Louis XIV. Voltaire, in fact, was in things
political a conservative, save insofar as he fought for toleration, for
lenity, and for the most necessary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285"
href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>reforms. And if
Voltaire&rsquo;s attack on what he held to be a demoralizing and knew
to be a persecuting religion be saddled with the causation of the
political crash, the blame will have to be carried back equally to the
English deists and the tyranny of Louis XIV. To such indictments, as
Barante protests, there is no limit: every age pivots on its
predecessor; and to blame for the French Revolution everybody but a
corrupt aristocracy, a tyrannous and ruinously spendthrift monarchy,
and a cruel church, is to miss the last semblance of judicial method.
It may be conceded that the works of Meslier and d&rsquo;Holbach,
neither of whom is noticed by Barante, are directly though only
generally revolutionary in their bearing. But the main works of
d&rsquo;Holbach appeared too close upon the Revolution to be credited
with generating it; and Meslier, as we know, had been generally read
only in abridgments and adaptations, in which his political doctrine
disappears.</p>
<p class="par">Mallet du Pan, striking in all directions, indicts
alternately Rousseau, whose vogue lay largely among religious people,
and the downright freethinkers. The great fomenter of the Revolution,
the critic avows, was Rousseau. &ldquo;He had a hundred times more
readers than Voltaire in the middle and lower classes.... No one has
more openly attacked the right of property in declaring it a
usurpation.... It is he alone who has inoculated the French with the
doctrine of the sovereignty of the people, and with its most extreme
consequences.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18733src" href=
"#xd21e18733" name="xd21e18733src">253</a> After this &ldquo;he
alone,&rdquo; the critic obliviously proceeds to exclaim:
&ldquo;Diderot and Condorcet: there are the true chiefs of the
revolutionary school,&rdquo; adding that Diderot had &ldquo;proclaimed
equality before Marat; the Rights of Man before Si&eacute;y&egrave;s;
sacred insurrection before Mirabeau and Lafayette; the massacre of
priests before the Septembrists.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18736src" href="#xd21e18736" name="xd21e18736src">254</a> But
this is mere furious declamation. Only by heedless misreading or malice
can support be given to the pretence that Diderot wrought for the
violent overthrow of the existing political system. Passages denouncing
kingly tyranny had been inserted in their plays by both Corneille and
Voltaire, and applauded by audiences who never dreamt of abolishing
monarchy. A phrase about strangling kings in the bowels of priests is
expressly put by Diderot in the mouth of an <i lang=

"noteref" id="xd21e18744src" href="#xd21e18744" name=
"xd21e18744src">255</a> which shows that the type had arisen in his
lifetime in opposition to his own bias. This very poem he read to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=

Empress Catherine and his own esteemed friend.<a class="noteref" id=

tyranny of the French Government, swayed by the king&rsquo;s mistresses
and favourites and by the Jesuits, he did indeed detest, as he had
cause to do, and as every man of good feeling did with him; but no
writing of his wrought measurably for its violent overthrow.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18762src" href="#xd21e18762" name=
"xd21e18762src">257</a> D&rsquo;Argenson in 1751 was expressing his
fears of a revolution, and noting the &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">d&eacute;sobeissance constante</span>&rdquo; of the Parlement of
Paris and the disaffection of the people, before he had heard of
&ldquo;<span lang="fr"><i>un</i> M. Diderot, qui a beaucoup
d&rsquo;esprit, mais qui affecte trop l&rsquo;irreligion.</span>&rdquo;
And when he notes that the Jesuits have secured the suppression of the
<i lang="fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i> as being hostile &ldquo;to God and
the royal authority,&rdquo; he does not attach the slightest weight to
the charge. He knew that Louis called the pious Jansenists
&ldquo;enemies of God and of the king.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">Mallet du Pan grounds his charge against Diderot almost
solely on &ldquo;those incendiary diatribes intercalated in the
<i lang="fr">Histoire philosophique des deux Indes</i> which dishonour
that work, and which Raynal, in his latter days, excised with horror
from a new edition which he was preparing.&rdquo; But supposing the

to be saddled with responsibility for the Reign of Terror only on the
principle that it was more provocative in the days of tyranny to
denounce than to exercise it. To this complexion Mallet du Pan came,
with the anti-Revolutionists in general; but to-day we can recognize in
the whole process of reasoning a <i lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>.
The school in question came in all seriousness to ascribe the evils of
the Revolution to everything and everybody save the men and classes
whose misgovernment made the Revolution inevitable.</p>
<p class="par">Some of the philosophers, it is true, themselves gave
colour to the view that they were the makers of the Revolution, as when
D&rsquo;Alembert said to Romilly that &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; had
produced in his time that change in the popular mind which exhibited
itself in the indifference with which they received the news of the
birth of the dauphin.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18801src" href=
"#xd21e18801" name="xd21e18801src">260</a> The error is none the less
plain. The <i lang="fr">philosophes</i> had done nothing to promote
anti-monarchism among the common people, who did not read.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18809src" href="#xd21e18809" name=
"xd21e18809src">261</a> It was the whole political and social
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>evolution of two generations that had wrought
the change; and the people were still for the most part believing
Catholics. Frederick the Great was probably within the mark when in
1769 he privately reminded the more optimistic philosophers that their
entire French public did not number above 200,000 persons. The people
of Paris, who played the chief part in precipitating the Revolution,
were spontaneously mutinous and disorderly, but were certainly not in
any considerable number unbelievers. &ldquo;While Voltaire
dechristianized a portion of polite society the people remained very
pious, even at Paris. In 1766 Louis XV, so unpopular, was acclaimed
because he knelt, on the Pont Neuf, before the Holy
Sacrament.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18827src" href=
"#xd21e18827" name="xd21e18827src">262</a></p>
<p class="par">And this is the final answer to any pretence that the
Revolution was the work of the school of d&rsquo;Holbach. Bergier the
priest, and Rivarol the conservative unbeliever, alike denied that
d&rsquo;Holbach&rsquo;s systematic writings had any wide public.
Doubtless the same men were ready to eat their words for the
satisfaction of vilifying an opponent. It has always been the way of
orthodoxy to tell atheists alternately that they are an impotent
handful and that they are the ruin of society. But by this time it
ought to be a matter of elementary knowledge that a great political
revolution can be wrought only by far-reaching political forces,
whether or not these may concur with a propaganda of rationalism in
religion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18835src" href="#xd21e18835" name=

anti-clerical, not anti-Christian, and who actually censured the
revolutionary procedure. When he published his first edition he must be
held to have acquiesced in its doctrine, whether it were from
Diderot&rsquo;s pen or his own. Rousseau and Raynal were the two most
popular writers of their day who dealt with social as apart from
religious or philosophical issues, and to both is thus imputed a
general subversiveness. But here too the charge rests upon a
sociological fallacy. The Parlement of Paris, composed of rich
bourgeois and aristocrats, many of them Jansenists, very few
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>of them freethinkers, most of them ready to burn
freethinking books, played a &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; part throughout
the century, inasmuch as it so frequently resisted the king&rsquo;s
will.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18846src" href="#xd21e18846" name=
"xd21e18846src">265</a> The stars in their courses fought against the
old despotism. Rousseau was ultimately influential towards change
because change was inevitable and essential, not because he was
restless. The whole drift of things furthered his ideas, which at the
outset won no great vogue. He was followed because he set forth what so
many felt; and similarly Raynal was read because he chimed with a
strengthening feeling. In direct contradiction to Mallet du Pan,
Chamfort, a keener observer, wrote while the Revolution was still in
action that &ldquo;the priesthood was the first bulwark of absolute
power, and Voltaire overthrew it. Without this decisive and
indispensable first step nothing would have been done.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18849src" href="#xd21e18849" name=
"xd21e18849src">266</a> The same observer goes on to say that
Rousseau&rsquo;s political works, and particularly the <i lang=
"fr">Contrat Social</i>, &ldquo;were fitted for few readers, and caused
no alarm at court.... That theory was regarded as a hollow speculation
which could have no further consequences than the enthusiasm for
liberty and the contempt of royalty carried so far in the pieces of
Corneille, and applauded at court by the most absolute of kings, Louis
XIV. All that seemed to belong to another world, and to have no
connection with ours; ... in a word, Voltaire above all has made the
Revolution, because he has written for all; Rousseau above all has made
the Constitution because he has written for the
thinkers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18858src" href=
"#xd21e18858" name="xd21e18858src">267</a> And so the changes may be
rung for ever. The final philosophy of history cannot be reached by any
such artificial selection of factors;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18863src" href="#xd21e18863" name="xd21e18863src">268</a> and the
ethical problem equally evades such solutions. If we are to pass any
ethico-political judgment whatever, it must be that the evils of the
Revolution lie at the door not of the reformers, but of the men, the
classes, and the institutions which first provoked and then resisted
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18872src" href="#xd21e18872" name=
"xd21e18872src">269</a> To describe the former as the authors of the
process is as intelligent as it was to charge upon Sokrates the decay
of orthodox tradition in Athens, and to charge upon that the later
downfall of the Athenian empire. The wisest men of the age, notably the
great Turgot, sought a gradual transformation, a peaceful and harmless
transition from unconstitutional to constitutional government.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>Their policy was furiously resisted by an
unteachable aristocracy. When at last fortuitous violence made a breach
in the feudal walls, a people unprepared for self-rule, and fought by
an aristocracy eager for blood, surged into anarchy, and convulsion
followed on convulsion. That is in brief the history of the
Revolution.</p>
<p id="ch17.31" class="par">31. While the true causation of the
Revolution is thus kept clear, it must not be forgotten, further, that
to the very last, save where controlled by disguised rationalists like
Malesherbes, the tendency of the old r&eacute;gime was to persecute
brutally and senselessly wherever it could lay hands on a freethinker.
In 1788, only a year before the first explosion of the Revolution,
there appeared the <i lang="fr">Almanach des Honn&ecirc;tes Gens</i> of
<span class="sc">Sylvain Mar&eacute;chal</span>, a work of which the
offence consisted not in any attack upon religion, but in simply
constructing a calendar in which the names of renowned laymen were
substituted for saints. Instantly it was denounced by the Paris
Parlement, the printer prosecuted, and the author imprisoned; and De
Sauvigny, the censor who had passed the book, was exiled thirty leagues
from Paris.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18891src" href="#xd21e18891"
name="xd21e18891src">270</a></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Some idea of the intensity of the tyranny over all
literature in France under the Old R&eacute;gime may be gathered from
Buckle&rsquo;s compendious account of the books officially condemned,
and of authors punished, during the two generations before the
Revolution. Apart from the record of the treatment of Buffon,
Marmontel, Morellet, Voltaire, and Diderot, it runs: &ldquo;The ...
tendency was shown in matters so trifling that nothing but the gravity
of their ultimate results prevents them from being ridiculous. In 1770,
Imbert translated Clarke&rsquo;s <i>Letters on Spain</i>, one of the
best works then existing on that country. This book, however, was
suppressed as soon as it appeared; and the only reason assigned for
such a stretch of power is that it contained some remarks respecting
the passion of Charles III for hunting, which were considered
disrespectful to the French crown, because Louis XV himself was a great
hunter. Several years before this La Bletterie, who was favourably
known in France by his works, was elected a member of the French
Academy. But he, it seems, was a Jansenist, and had moreover ventured
to assert that the Emperor Julian, notwithstanding his apostasy, was
not entirely devoid of good qualities. Such offences could not be
overlooked in so pure an age; and the king obliged the Academy to
exclude La Bletterie from their society. That the punishment extended
no further was an instance of remarkable leniency; for Fr&eacute;ret,
an eminent critic and scholar, was confined in the Bastille because he
stated, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>in one of his memoirs, that the earliest
Frankish chiefs had received their titles from the Romans. The same
penalty was inflicted four different times upon Lenglet du Fresnoy. In
the case of this amiable and accomplished man, there seems to have been
hardly the shadow of a pretext for the cruelty with which he was
treated; though on one occasion the alleged offence was that he had
published a supplement to the History of De Thou.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Indeed, we have only to open the biographies and
correspondence of that time to find instances crowding upon us from all
quarters. Rousseau was threatened with imprisonment, was driven from
France, and his works were publicly burned. The celebrated treatise of
Helv&eacute;tius on the Mind was suppressed by an order of the Royal
Council; it was burned by the common hangman, and the author was
compelled to write two letters retracting his opinions. Some of the
geological views of Buffon having offended the clergy, that illustrious
naturalist was obliged to publish a formal recantation of doctrines
which are now known to be perfectly accurate. The learned
<i>Observations on the History of France</i>, by Mably, were suppressed
as soon as they appeared: for what reason it would be hard to say,
since M. Guizot, certainly no friend either to anarchy or to
irreligion, has thought it worth while to republish them, and thus
stamp them with the authority of his own great name. <i>The History of
the Indies</i>, by Raynal, was condemned to the flames, and the author
ordered to be arrested. Lanjuinais, in his well-known work on Joseph
II, advocated not only religious toleration, but even the abolition of
slavery; his book, therefore, was declared to be
&lsquo;seditious&rsquo;; it was pronounced &lsquo;destructive of all
subordination,&rsquo; and was sentenced to be burned. The <i>Analysis
of Bayle</i>, by Marsy, was suppressed, and the author was imprisoned.
The <i>History of the Jesuits</i>, by Linguet, was delivered to the
flames; eight years later his journal was suppressed; and, three years
after that, as he still persisted in writing, his <i>Political
Annals</i> were suppressed, and he himself was thrown into the
Bastille. Delisle de Sales was sentenced to perpetual exile and
confiscation of all his property on account of his work on the
<i>Philosophy of Nature</i>. The treatise by Mey, on French Law, was
suppressed; that by Boncerf, on Feudal Law, was burned. <i>The Memoirs
of Beaumarchais</i> were likewise burned; the <i><span lang=
"fr">&Eacute;loge</span> on F&eacute;nelon</i>, by La Harpe, was merely
suppressed. Duvernet, having written a <i>History of the Sorbonne</i>,
which was still unpublished, was seized and thrown into the Bastille,
while the manuscript was yet in his own possession. The celebrated work
of De Lolme on the English constitution was suppressed by edict
directly it appeared. The fate of being suppressed or prohibited also
awaited the Letters of Gervaise in 1724; the Dissertations of Courayer
in 1727; the Letters of Montgon in 1732; the <i>History of
Tamerlane</i>, by Margat, also in 1732; the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span><i>Essay on Taste</i>, by Cartaud, in 1736; The
<i>Life of Domat</i>, by Pr&eacute;vost de la Jann&egrave;s, in 1742;
the <i>History of Louis XI</i>, by Duclos, in 1745; the Letters of
Bargeton in 1750; the <i>Memoirs on Troyes</i>, by Grosley, in the same
year; the <i>History of Clement XI</i>, by Reboulet, in 1752; The
<i>School of Man</i>, by G&eacute;nard, also in 1752; the
<i>Therapeutics</i> of Garlon in 1756; the celebrated thesis of Louis,
on <i>Generation</i>, in 1754; the treatise on <i>Presidial
Jurisdiction</i>, by Jousse, in 1755; the <i>Ericie</i> of Fontenelle
in 1768; the <i>Thoughts of Jamin</i> in 1769; the <i>History of
Siam</i>, by Turpin, and the <i>&Eacute;loge of Marcus Aurelius</i>, by
Thomas, both in 1770; the works on Finance by Darigrand, in 1764, and
by Le Trosne in 1779; the <i>Essay on Military Tactics</i>, by Guibert,
in 1772; the Letters of Boucquet in the same year; and the <i>Memoirs
of Terrai</i>, by Coquereau, in 1776. Such wanton destruction of
property was, however, mercy itself compared to the treatment
experienced by other literary men in France. Desforges, for example,
having written against the arrest of the Pretender to the English
throne, was, solely on that account, buried in a dungeon eight feet
square and confined there for three years. This happened in 1749; and
in 1770, Audra, professor at the College of Toulouse, and a man of some
reputation, published the first volume of his <i>Abridgement of General
History</i>. Beyond this the work never proceeded; it was at once
condemned by the archbishop of the diocese, and the author was deprived
of his office. Audra, held up to public opprobrium, the whole of his
labours rendered useless, and the prospects of his life suddenly
blighted, was unable to survive the shock. He was struck with apoplexy,
and within twenty-four hours was lying a corpse in his own
house.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p id="ch17.32" class="par">32. Among many other illustrations of the
passion for persecution in the period may be noted the fact that after
the death of the atheist Damilaville his enemies contrived to deprive
his brother of a post from which he had his sole livelihood.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18994src" href="#xd21e18994" name=
"xd21e18994src">271</a> It is but one of an infinity of proofs that the
spirit of sheer sectarian malevolence, which is far from being
eliminated in modern life, was in the French Church of the eighteenth
century the ruling passion. Lovers of moderate courses there were, even
in the Church; but even among professors of lenity we find an ingrained
belief in the virtue of vituperation and coercion. And it is not until
the persecuted minority has developed its power of written retaliation,
and the deadly arrows of Voltaire have aroused in the minds of
persecutors a new terror, that there seems to arise on that side a
suspicion that there can be any better way of handling unbelief than by
invective and imprisonment. After they had taught the heretics to
defend themselves, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>found them possessed of weapons
such as orthodoxy could not hope to handle, we find Churchmen talking
newly of the duty of gentleness towards error; and even then clinging
to the last to the weapons of public ostracism and aspersion. So the
fight was of necessity fought on the side of freethought in the temper
of men warring on incorrigible oppression and cruelty as well as on
error. The wonder is that the freethinkers preserved so much
amenity.</p>
<p id="ch17.33" class="par">33. This section would not be complete even
in outline without some notice of the attitude held towards religion by
Napoleon, who at once crowned and in large measure undid the work of
the Revolution. He has his place in its religious legend in the current
datum that he wrought for the faith by restoring a suppressed public
worship and enabling the people of France once more to hear
church-bells. In point of fact, as was pointed out by Bishop
Gr&eacute;goire in 1826, &ldquo;it is materially proved that in 1796,
before he was Consul, and four years before the Concordat, according to
a statement drawn up at the office of the Domaines Nationaux, there
were in France 32,214 parishes where the culte was carried
on.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19001src" href="#xd21e19001"
name="xd21e19001src">272</a> Other commonplaces concerning Napoleon are
not much better founded. On the strength of a number of oral
utterances, many of them imperfectly vouched for, and none of them
marked by much deliberation, he has been claimed by Carlyle<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e19016src" href="#xd21e19016" name=
"xd21e19016src">273</a> as a theist who philosophically disdained the
&ldquo;clatter of materialism,&rdquo; and believed in a Personal
Creator of an infinite universe; while by others he is put forward as a
kind of expert in character study who vouched for the divinity of
Jesus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19020src" href="#xd21e19020" name=
"xd21e19020src">274</a> In effect, his verdict that &ldquo;this was not
a man&rdquo; would tell, if anything, in favour of the view that Jesus
is a mythical construction. He was, indeed, by temperament
quasi-religious, liking the sound of church bells and the atmosphere of
devotion; and in his boyhood he had been a rather fervent Catholic. As
he grew up he read, like his contemporaries, the French deists of his
time, and became a deist like his fellows, recognizing that religions
were human productions. Declaring that he was &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">loin d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre ath&eacute;e</span>,&rdquo; he propounded
to O&rsquo;Meara all the conventional views&mdash;that religion should
be made a support to morals and law; that men need to believe in
marvels; that religion is a great consolation to those who believe in
it; and that &ldquo;no one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>can tell what he will do in his
last moments.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19032src" href=
"#xd21e19032" name="xd21e19032src">275</a> The opinion to which he
seems to have adhered most steadily was that every man should die in
the religion in which he had been brought up. And he himself officially
did so, though he put off almost to the last the formality of a
deathbed profession. His language on the subject is irreconcilable with
any real belief in the Christian religion: he was &ldquo;a deist
<i lang="fr">&agrave; la</i> Voltaire who recalled with tenderness his
Catholic childhood, and who at death reverted to his first
beliefs.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19041src" href="#xd21e19041"
name="xd21e19041src">276</a> For the rest, he certainly believed in
religion as a part of the machinery of the State, and repeated the
usual platitudes about its value as a moral restraint. He was candid
enough, however, not to pretend that it had ever restrained him; and no
freethinker condemned more sweepingly than he the paralysing effect of
the Catholic system on Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19047src"
href="#xd21e19047" name="xd21e19047src">277</a> To the Church his
attitude was purely political; and his personal liking for the Pope
never moved him to yield, where he could avoid it, to the temporal
pretensions of the papacy. The Concordat of 1802, that &ldquo;brilliant
triumph over the genius of the Revolution,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e19052src" href="#xd21e19052" name="xd21e19052src">278</a> was
purely and simply a political measure. If he had had his way, he would
have set up a system of religious councils in France, to be utilized
against all disturbing tendencies in politics.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e19061src" href="#xd21e19061" name="xd21e19061src">279</a> Had he
succeeded, he was capable of suppressing all manifestations of
freethought in the interests of &ldquo;order.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e19073src" href="#xd21e19073" name="xd21e19073src">280</a> He
had, in fact, no disinterested love of truth; and we have his express
declaration, at St. Helena, on the subject of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr">Tartufe</i>: &ldquo;I do not hesitate to say that if the
piece had been written in my time, I would not have permitted its
representation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19088src" href=
"#xd21e19088" name="xd21e19088src">281</a> Freethought can make no warm
claim to the allegiance of such a ruler; and if the Church of Rome is
concerned to claim him as a son on the score of his deathbed adherence,
after a reign which led the Catholic clergy of Spain to hold him up to
the faithful as an incarnation of the devil,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e19094src" href="#xd21e19094" name="xd21e19094src">282</a> she
will hardly gain by the association. Napoleon&rsquo;s ideas on
religious questions were in fact no more noteworthy than his views on
economics, which were thoroughly conventional. <span class=

Lanson, p. 702. The <i>Persian Letters</i>, like the <i>Provincial
Letters</i> of Pascal, had to be printed at Rouen and published at
Amsterdam. Their freethinking expressions put considerable difficulties
in the way of his election (1727) to the Academy. See E. Edwards,

Duvernet, ch. ii. The free-hearted <span class="sc" lang="fr">Ninon de
l&rsquo;Enclos</span>, brightest of old ladies, is to be numbered among
the pre-Voltairean freethinkers, and to be remembered as leaving young
Voltaire a legacy to buy books. She refused to &ldquo;sell her
soul&rdquo; by turning d&eacute;vote on the invitation of her old
friend Madame de Maintenon. Madame D&rsquo;&Eacute;pinay,
Voltaire&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span lang="fr">belle philosophe et aimable
Habacuc,</span>&rdquo; Madame du Deffand, and Madame Geoffrin were
among the later freethinking <i lang="fr">grandes dames</i> of the

165&ndash;70, 257&ndash;58. The erection by the French freethinkers of
a monument to La Barre in 1905, opposite the Cathedral of the Sacred
Heart, Montmartre, Paris, is an expression at once of the old feud with
the Church and the French appreciation of high personal courage. La
Barre was in truth something of a scapegrace, but his execution was an
infamy, and he went to his death as to a bridal. The erection of the
monument has been the occasion of a futile pretence on the clerical
side that for La Barre&rsquo;s death the Church had no responsibility,
the movers in the case being laymen. Nothing, apparently, can teach
Catholic Churchmen that the Church&rsquo;s past sins ought to be
confessed like those of individuals. It is quite true that it was a
Parlement that condemned La Barre. But what a religious training was it
that turned laymen into murderous fanatics!&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<i lang="fr">Nouvelles Libert&eacute;s de Penser</i>, 1743 and 1750,
and in the <i lang="fr">Recueil Philosophique</i>, 1770. In the 1793
rep. of the <i lang="fr">Essai sur les pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s</i>
(again rep. in 1822) it is unhesitatingly affirmed, on the strength of
its title-page and the prefixed letter of Dumarsais, dated 1750, that
that book is an expansion of the essay <i lang="fr">Le Philosophe</i>,
and that this was published in 1760. But <i lang="fr">Le Philosophe</i>
is an entirely different production, which to a certain extent
criticizes <i lang="fr">les philosophes</i> so-called. The <i lang=
"fr">Essai sur les pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s</i> published in 1770 is not
the work of Dumarsais; it is a new work by d&rsquo;Holbach. This was
apparently known to Frederick, who in his rather angry criticism of the
book writes that, whereas Dumarsais had always respected constituted
authorities, others had &ldquo;put out in his name, two years after he
was dead and buried, a libel of which the veritable author could only
be a schoolboy as new to the world as he was puzzle-headed.&rdquo;
(<i lang="fr">M&eacute;langes en vers et en prose de Frederic II</i>,
1792, ii, 215). Dumarsais died in 1754, but I can find no good evidence
that the <i lang="fr">Essai sur les pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s</i> was ever
printed before 1770. As to d&rsquo;Holbach&rsquo;s authorship see the
<i lang="fr">&OElig;uvres de Diderot</i>, ed. 1821, xii, 115
<i>sq.</i>&mdash;passage copied in the 1829&ndash;31 ed. of the
<i lang="fr">Correspondance litt&eacute;raire</i> of Grimm and Diderot,
xiv, 293 <i>sq.</i> In a letter to D&rsquo;Alembert dated Mars 27,
1773, Voltaire writes that in a newly-printed collection of treatises
containing his own <i lang="fr">Lois de Minos</i> is included
&ldquo;<span lang="fr"><i>le philosophe</i> de Dumarsais, qui n&rsquo;a
jamais &eacute;t&eacute; imprim&eacute; jusqu&rsquo;&agrave;

Lazarus, the first being that the dead do not rise. His scholarly

Diderot&rsquo;s daughter, in her memoir of him, speaks of his
imprisonment in the Bastille as brought about through the resentment of
a lady of whom he had spoken slightingly; and her husband left a
statement in MS. to the same effect (printed at the end of the <i lang=
"fr">M&eacute;moires</i> by Naigeon). The lady is named as Madame
Dupr&eacute; de Saint-Maur, a mistress of the King, and the offence is
said to have been committed in the story entitled <i lang="fr">Le
Pigeon blanc</i>. Howsoever this may have been, the prosecution was
quite in the spirit of the period, and the earlier <i lang=
"fr">Pens&eacute;es</i> were made part of the case against him. See
Delort, <i lang="fr">Hist. de la d&eacute;tention des philosophes</i>,
1829, ii, 208&ndash;16. M. de Vandeul-Diderot testifies that the
Marquis Du Chatelet, Governor of Vincennes, treated his prisoner very
kindly. Buckle (1-vol. ed. p. 425) does not seem to have fully read the

to Mdlle. Voland (<span lang="fr">15 juillet, 1759</span>); and Lord
Morley pronounces de Prades a rascal (<i>Diderot</i>, p. 98). Carlyle
is inarticulate with disgust&mdash;but as much against the original
heresy as against the treason to Frederick. As to that,
Thi&eacute;bault was convinced that de Prades was innocent and
calumniated. Everybody at court, he declares, held the same view.

Thus Dr. Cairns (<i>Unbelief in the Eighteenth Century</i>, p. 165)
gravely argues that the French Revolution proves the inefficacy of
theism without a Trinity to control conduct. He has omitted to compare
the theistic bloodshed of the Revolution with the Trinitarian bloodshed
of the Crusades, the papal suppression of the Albigenses, the Hussite
wars, and other orthodox undertakings.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

book was accorded the Monthyon prize by the French Academy. In
translation (1788) it found a welcome in England among Churchmen by
reason of its pro-Christian tone and its general vindication of
religious institutions. The translation was the work of Mary
Wollstonecraft. See Kegan Paul&rsquo;s <i>William Godwin</i>, 1876, i,
193. Mrs. Dunlop, the friend of Burns, recommending its perusal to the
poet, paid it a curious compliment: &ldquo;He does not write like a
sectary, <i>hardly like a Christian</i>, but yet while I read him, I
like better my God, my neighbour, Monsieur Necker, and myself.&rdquo;

it is customary among Christians to speak of this lady in the most
opprobrious terms. The royalist (but malcontent) Marquis de Villeneuve,
who had seen the Revolution in his youth, claimed in his old age to
have afterwards &ldquo;conversed with the Goddess Reason of Paris and
with the Goddess Reason of Bourges&rdquo; (where he became governor);
but, though he twice alludes to those women, he says nothing whatever
against their characters (<i lang="fr">De l&rsquo;Agonie de la

prejudice, is satisfied that the women chosen as Goddesses of Reason

Charles Comte is thus partly inaccurate in saying (<i lang=
"fr">Trait&eacute; de L&eacute;gislation</i>, 1835, i, 72) that the
charge against the philosophers began &ldquo;on the day on which there
was set up a government in France that sought to re-establish the
abuses of which they had sought the destruction.&rdquo; What is true is
that the charge, framed at once by the backers of the Old

Mallet actually reproaches the <i lang="fr">philosophes</i> in the
mass&mdash;while admitting the hostility of many of them to the
Revolution&mdash;with &ldquo;having accelerated French degeneration and
depravation ... by rendering the conscience argumentative (<i lang=
"fr">raisonneuse</i>), by substituting for duties inculcated by
sentiment, tradition, and habit, the <i>uncertain rules of the human
reason</i> and sophisms adapted to passions,&rdquo; etc., etc. (B.
Mallet, as cited, p. 360). With all his natural vigour of mind, Mallet
du Pan thus came to talk the language of the ordinary irrationalist of
the Reaction. Certainly, if the stimulation of the habit of reasoning
be a destructive course, the philosophes stand condemned. But as
Christians had been reasoning as best they could, in an eternal series
of vain disputes, for a millennium and a-half before the Revolution,
with habitual appeal to the passions, the argument only proves how
vacuous a Christian champion&rsquo;s reasoning can be.&nbsp;<a class=

official hostility.</p>
<p class="par">In such circumstances, the active freethought existing
in France at the beginning of the seventeenth century could not fail to
affect Germany; and even before the date of the polemic of Garasse and
Mersenne there appeared (1615) a counterblast to the new thought in the
<i lang="la">Theologia Naturalis</i> of J. H. Alsted, of Frankfort,
directed <i lang="la">adversus atheos, Epicureos, et sophistas hujus
temporis</i>. The preface to this solid quarto (a remarkable sample of
good printing for the period) declares that &ldquo;there are men in
this diseased (<i lang="la">exulcerato</i>) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>age
who dare to oppose science to revelation, reason to faith, nature to
grace, the creator to the redeemer, and truth to truth&rdquo;; and the
writer undertakes to rise argumentatively from nature to the Christian
God, without, however, transcending the logical plane of De Mornay. The
trouble of the time, unhappily for the faith, was not rationalism, but
the inextinguishable hatreds of Protestant and Catholic, and the strife
of economic interests dating from the appropriations of the first
reformers. At length, after a generation of gloomy suspense, came the
explosion of the hostile ecclesiastical interests, and the long-drawn
horror of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, which left Germany mangled,
devastated, drained of blood and treasure, decivilized, and well-nigh
destitute of the machinery of culture. No such printing as that of
Alsted&rsquo;s book was to be done in the German world for many
generations. But as in France, so in Germany, the exhausting experience
of the moral and physical evil of religious war wrought something of an
antidote, in the shape of a new spirit of rationalism.</p>
<p class="par">Not only was the Peace of Westphalia an essentially
secular arrangement, subordinating all religious claims to a political
settlement,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19158src" href="#xd21e19158"
name="xd21e19158src">6</a> but the drift of opinion was markedly
freethinking. Already in 1630 one writer describes &ldquo;three classes
of skeptics among the nobility of Hamburg: first, those who believe
that religion is nothing but a mere fiction, invented to keep the
masses in restraint; second, those who give preference to no faith, but
think that all religions have a germ of truth; and third, those who,
confessing that there must be one true religion, are unable to decide
whether it is papal, Calvinist, or Lutheran, and consequently believe
nothing at all.&rdquo; No less explicit is the written testimony of
Walther, the court chaplain of Ulrich II of East Friesland, 1637:
&ldquo;These infernal courtiers, among whom I am compelled to live
against my will, doubt those truths which even the heathen have learned
to believe.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19164src" href=
"#xd21e19164" name="xd21e19164src">7</a> In Germany as in France the
freethinking which thus grew up during the religious war expanded after
the peace. As usual, this is to be gathered from the orthodox
propaganda against it, setting out in 1662 with a <i>Preservative
against the Pest of Present-day Atheists</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e19170src" href="#xd21e19170" name="xd21e19170src">8</a> by one
Theophilus Gegenbauer. So far was this from attaining its end that
there ensued ere long a more positive and aggressive development of
freethinking than any other country had yet seen. A wandering
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>scholar, <span class="sc">Matthias
Knutzen</span> of Holstein (b. 1645), who had studied philosophy at
K&ouml;nigsberg, went about in 1674 teaching a hardy Religion of
Humanity, rejecting alike immortality, God and Devil, churches and
priests, and insisting that conscience could perfectly well take the
place of the Bible as a guide to conduct. His doctrines are to be
gathered chiefly from a curious Latin letter,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e19180src" href="#xd21e19180" name="xd21e19180src">9</a> written
by him for circulation, headed <i lang="la">Amicus Amicis Amica</i>;
and in this the profession of atheism is explicit: &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Insuper Deum negamus</i>.&rdquo; In two dialogues in German he set
forth the same ideas. His followers, as holding by conscience, were
called <i lang="de">Gewissener</i>; and he or another of his group
asserted that in Jena alone there were seven hundred of them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e19192src" href="#xd21e19192" name=
"xd21e19192src">10</a> The figures were fantastic, and the whole
movement passed rapidly out of sight&mdash;hardly by reason of the
orthodox refutations, however. Germany was in no state to sustain such
a party; and what happened was a necessarily slow gestation of the seed
of new thought thus cast abroad.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Knutzen&rsquo;s Latin letter is given in full by a
Welsh scholar settled in Germany, Jenkinus Thomasius (Jenkin Thomas),
in his <i lang="la">Historia Atheismi</i> (Altdorf, 1692), ed. Basel,
1709, pp. 97&ndash;101; also by La Croze in his (anon.) <i lang=
"fr">Entretiens sur divers sujets</i>, 1711, p. 402 <i>sq.</i>
Thomasius thus codifies its doctrine:&mdash;&ldquo;1. There is neither
God nor Devil. 2. The magistrate is nothing to be esteemed; temples are
to be condemned, priests to be rejected. 3. In place of the magistrate
and the priest are to be put knowledge and reason, joined with
conscience, which teaches to live honestly, to injure none, and to give
each his own. 4. Marriage and free union do not differ. 5. This is the
only life: after it, there is neither reward nor punishment. 6. The
Scripture contradicts itself.&rdquo; Knutzen admittedly wrote like a
scholar (Thomasius, p. 97); but his treatment of Scripture
contradictions belongs to the infancy of criticism; though La Croze,
replying thirty years later, could only meet it with charges of impiety
and stupidity. As to the numbers of the movement see Trinius, <i lang=
"nl">Freydenker Lexicon</i>, 1759, s. v. <span class=
"sc">Knutzen</span>. Kurtz (<i>Hist. of the Christian Church</i>, Eng.
tr. 1864, i, 213) states that a careful academic investigation proved
the claim to a membership of 700 to be an empty boast (citing H.
Rossel, <i lang="de">Studien und Kritiken</i>, 1844, iv). This
doubtless refers to the treatise of Mus&aelig;us, Jena, 1675, cited by
La Croze, p. 401. Some converts Knutzen certainly made; and as only the
hardiest would dare to avow themselves, his influence may have been
considerable. &ldquo;Examples of total unbelief come only singly to
knowledge,&rdquo; says Tholuck; &ldquo;but total unbelief had still to
the end of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>century to bear penal treatment.&rdquo; He gives
the instances (1) of the Swedish Baron Skytte, reported in 1669 by
Spener to the Frankfort authorities for having said at table, before
the court preacher, that the Scriptures were not holy, and not from God
but from men; and (2) &ldquo;a certain minister&rdquo; who at the end
of the century was prosecuted for blasphemy. (<i lang="de">Das
kirchliche Leben des 17ten Jahrhunderts</i>, 2 Abth. pp. 56&ndash;57.)
Even Anabaptists were still liable to banishment in the middle of the
century. <i>Id.</i> 1 Abth. 1861, p. 36. As to clerical intolerance see
pp. 40&ndash;44. On the merits of the Knutzen movement cp. P&uuml;njer,

<p id="ch18.3" class="par">3. For a community in which the reading
class was mainly clerical and scholastic, the seeds of rationalism were
thus in part sown in the seventeenth century; but the ground was not
yet propitious. <span class="sc">Leibnitz</span> (1646&ndash;1716), the
chief thinker produced by Germany before Kant, lived in a state of
singular intellectual isolation;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19536src"
href="#xd21e19536" name="xd21e19536src">19</a> and showed his sense of
it by writing his philosophic treatises chiefly in French. One of the
most widely learned men of his age, he was wont from his boyhood to
grapple critically with every system of thought that came in his way;
and, while claiming to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href=

"noteref" id="xd21e19547src" href="#xd21e19547" name=
"xd21e19547src">20</a> he was as a rule strongly concerned to affirm
his own powerful bias. Early in life he writes that it horrifies him to
think how many men he has met who were at once intelligent and
atheistic;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19556src" href="#xd21e19556"
name="xd21e19556src">21</a> and his propaganda is always dominated by
the desire rather to confute unbelief than to find out the truth. As
early as 1668 (aet. 22) he wrote an essay to that end, which was
published as a <i lang="la">Confessio natur&aelig; contra
Atheistas</i>. Against Spinoza he reacted instantly and violently,
pronouncing the <i>Tractatus</i> on its first (anonymous) appearance an
&ldquo;unbearably bold (<i lang="la">licentiosum</i>) book,&rdquo; and
resenting the Hobbesian criticism which it &ldquo;dared to apply to
sacred Scripture.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19574src" href=
"#xd21e19574" name="xd21e19574src">22</a> Yet in the next year we find
him writing to Arnauld in earnest protest against the hidebound
orthodoxy of the Church. &ldquo;A philosophic age,&rdquo; he declares,
&ldquo;is about to begin, in which the concern for truth, flourishing
outside the schools, will spread even among politicians. Nothing is
more likely to strengthen atheism and to upset faith, already so shaken
by the attacks of great but bad men [a pleasing allusion to Spinoza],
than to see on the one side the mysteries of the faith preached upon as
the creed of all, and on the other hand become matter of derision to
all, convicted of absurdity by the most certain rules of common reason.
The worst enemies of the Church are in the Church. Let us take care
lest the latest heresy&mdash;I will not say atheism,
but&mdash;naturalism, be publicly professed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e19577src" href="#xd21e19577" name="xd21e19577src">23</a> For a
time he seemed thus disposed to liberalize. He wrote to Spinoza on
points of optics before he discovered the authorship; and he is
represented later as speaking of the <i>Tractatus</i> with respect. He
even visited Spinoza in 1676, and obtained a perusal of the manuscript
of the <i>Ethica</i>; but he remained hostile to him in theology and
philosophy. To the last he called Spinoza a mere developer of
Descartes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19587src" href="#xd21e19587"

clear was turned to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href=

the same fashion. It is very significant that such a philosopher,
himself much given to denying the religiousness of other men&rsquo;s
theories, was nevertheless accused among both the educated and the
populace of being essentially non-religious. Nominally he adhered to
the entire Christian system, including miracles, though he declared
that his belief in dogma rested on the agreement of reason with faith,

<p id="ch18.5" class="par">5. After the collapse of the popular
movement of Matthias Knutzen, the thin end of the new wedge may be seen
in the manifold work of <span class="sc">Christian Thomasius</span>
(1655&ndash;1728), who in 1687 published a treatise on &ldquo;Divine
Jurisprudence,&rdquo; in which the principles of Pufendorf on natural
law, already offensive to the theologians, were carried so far as to
give new offence. Reading Pufendorf in his nonage as a student of
jurisprudence, he was so conscious of the conflict between the
utilitarian and the Scriptural view of moral law that, taught by a
master who had denounced Pufendorf, he recoiled in a state of
theological fear.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19739src" href=
"#xd21e19739" name="xd21e19739src">45</a> Some years later, gaining
self-possession, he recognized the rationality of Pufendorf&rsquo;s
system, and both expounded and defended him, thus earning his share in
the hostility which the great jurist encountered at clerical hands.
Between that hostility and the naturalist bias which he had acquired
from Pufendorf, there grew up in him an aversion to the methods and
pretensions of theologians which made him their lifelong
antagonist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19745src" href="#xd21e19745"
name="xd21e19745src">46</a> Pufendorf had but guardedly introduced some

state, and thus preparing the way for utilitarianism.<a class="noteref"

sufficed to make the theologians his enemies; and it is significant
that Thomasius, heterodox at the outset only thus far forth, becomes
from that point onwards an important pioneer of freethought,
toleration, and humane reform. Innovating in all things, he began,
while still a <i lang="de">Privatdocent</i> at Leipzig University, a
campaign on behalf of the German language; and, not content with
arousing much pedantic enmity by delivering lectures for the first time
in his mother tongue, and deriding at the same time the bad scholastic
Latin of his compatriots, he set on foot the first vernacular German
periodical,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19767src" href="#xd21e19767"
name="xd21e19767src">48</a> which ran for two years (1688&ndash;90),
and caused so much anger that he was twice prosecuted before the
ecclesiastical court of Dresden, the second time on a charge of
contempt of religion. The periodical was in effect a crusade against
all the pedantries, the theologians coming in for the hardest

escape imprisonment, he sought the protection of the Elector of
Brandenburg at Halle, where he ultimately became professor of
jurisprudence in the new university, founded by his advice. There for a
time he leant towards the Pietists, finding in that body a concern for
natural liberty of feeling and thinking which was absent from the
mental life of orthodoxy; but he was &ldquo;of another spirit&rdquo;
than they, and took his own way.</p>
<p class="par">In philosophy an unsystematic pantheist, he taught,
after Plutarch, Bayle, and Bacon, that &ldquo;superstition is worse
than atheism&rdquo;; but his great practical service to German
civilization, over and above his furthering of the native speech, was
his vigorous polemic against prosecutions for heresy, trials for
witchcraft, and the use of torture, all of which he did more than any
other German to discredit, though judicial torture subsisted for
another half-century.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19791src" href=

emerges in the same period in Johann Conrad Dippel (1673&ndash;1734),
who developed a system of rationalistic mysticism, and as to whom, says

the class of pietists or of rationalists, of enthusiasts or of

under the pen-name of &ldquo;Christianus Democritus&rdquo; his book,
<i lang="de">Gest&auml;uptes Papstthum der Protestirenden</i>
(&ldquo;The Popery of the Protestantizers Whipped&rdquo;), in which he

own life he was much of an Ishmaelite, with wild notions of alchemy and
gold-making; and after predicting that he should live till 1808, he
died suddenly in 1734, leaving a doctrine which appealed only to those
constitutionally inclined, on the lines of the earlier English Quakers,
to set the inner light above Scripture.<a class="noteref" id=

<p id="ch18.7" class="par">7. Among the pupils of Thomasius at Halle
was Theodore Louis Lau, who, born of an aristocratic family, became
Minister of Finances to the Duke of Courland, and after leaving that
post held a high place in the service of the Elector Palatine. While
holding that office Lau published a small Latin volume of <i lang=
"fr">pens&eacute;es</i> entitled <i lang="la">Meditationes
Theologic&aelig;-Physic&aelig;</i>, notably deistic in tone. This gave
rise to such an outcry among the clergy that he had to leave Frankfort,
only, however, to be summoned before the consistory of K&ouml;nigsberg,
his native town, and charged with atheism (1719). He thereupon retired
to Altona, where he had freedom enough to publish a reply to his
clerical persecutors.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19885src" href=

<p id="ch18.8" class="par">8. While Thomasius was still at work, a new
force arose of a more distinctly academic cast. This was the adaptation
of Leibnitz&rsquo;s system by <span class="sc">Christian Wolff</span>,
who, after building up a large influence among students by his method
of teaching,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19896src" href="#xd21e19896"
name="xd21e19896src">61</a> came into public prominence by a rectorial
address<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19902src" href="#xd21e19902" name=
"xd21e19902src">62</a> at Halle (1721) in which he warmly praised the
ethics of Confucius. Such praise was naturally held to imply
disparagement of Christianity; and as a result of the pietist outcry
Wolff was condemned by the king to exile from Prussia, under penalty of
the gallows,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19905src" href="#xd21e19905"
name="xd21e19905src">63</a> all &ldquo;atheistical&rdquo; writings
being at the same time forbidden. Wolff&rsquo;s system, however,
prevailed so completely, in virtue of its lucidity and the
rationalizing tendency of the age, that in the year 1738 there were
said to be already 107 authors of his cast of thinking. Nevertheless,
he refused to return to Halle on any invitation till the accession
(1740) of Frederick the Great, one of his warmest admirers, whereafter
he figured as <i>the</i> German thinker of his age. His teaching, which
for the first time popularized philosophy in the German language, in
turn helped greatly, by its ratiocinative cast, to promote the
rationalistic temper, though orthodox enough from the modern point of
view. Under the new reign, however, pietism and Wolffism alike lost
prestige,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19912src" href="#xd21e19912" name=
"xd21e19912src">64</a> and the age of anti-Christian and Christian
rationalism began. Thus the period of freethinking in Germany follows
close upon one of religious revival. The 6,000 theologians trained at
Halle in the first generation of the century had &ldquo;worked like a
leaven through all Germany.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19918src"
href="#xd21e19918" name="xd21e19918src">65</a> &ldquo;Not since the

&ldquo;It cannot be questioned that, in his philosophy, the main stress

&ldquo;Francke and Lange (pietists) ... saw atheism and corruption of
manners springing up from Wolff&rsquo;s school&rdquo; (before his
exile). <i>Id.</i> p. 113. Wolff&rsquo;s chief offence lay in stressing
natural religion, and in indicating, as Tholuck observes, that that
could be demonstrated, whereas revealed religion could only be believed
(<i lang="de">Abriss</i>, p. 18). He greatly pleased Voltaire by the
dictum that men ought to be just even though they had the misfortune to
be atheists. It is noted by Tholuck, however (<i lang="de">Abriss</i>,
as cited, p. 11, <i>note</i>), that the decree for Wolff&rsquo;s
expulsion was inspired not by his theological colleagues but by two
military advisers of the king. Tholuck&rsquo;s own criticism resolves
itself into a protest against Wolff&rsquo;s predilection for logical
connection in his exposition. The fatal thing was that Wolff accustomed
German Christians to reason.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p id="ch18.9" class="par">9. Even before the generation of active
pressure from English and French deism there were clear signs that
rationalism had taken root in German life. On the impulse set up by the
establishment of the Grand Lodge at London in 1717, Freemasonic lodges
began to spring up in Germany, the first being founded at Hamburg in
1733.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19953src" href="#xd21e19953" name=
"xd21e19953src">67</a> The deism which in the English lodges was later
toned down by orthodox reaction was from the first pronounced in the
German societies, which ultimately passed on the tradition to the other
parts of the Continent. But the new spirit was not confined to secret
societies. Wolffianism worked widely. In the so-called <i>Wertheim
Bible</i> (1735) Johann Lorenz Schmid, in the spirit of the
Leibnitz-Wolffian theology, &ldquo;undertook to translate the Bible,
and to explain it according to the principle that in revelation only
that can be accepted as true which does not contradict the
reason.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19959src" href="#xd21e19959"
name="xd21e19959src">68</a> This of course involved no thorough-going
criticism; but the spirit of innovation was strong enough in Schmid to
make him undermine tradition at many points, and later carried him so
far as to translate Tindal&rsquo;s <i>Christianity as old as
Creation</i>. So far was he in advance of his time that when his
Wertheim Bible was officially condemned throughout Germany he found no
defenders.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19968src" href="#xd21e19968"

comparison generally orthodox; and another writer of the same school,
Martin Knutzen, professor at K&ouml;nigsberg (1715&ndash;1751),
undertook in a youthful thesis <i lang="la">De &aelig;ternitate mundi
impossibili</i> (1735) to rebut the old Averro&iuml;st doctrine,
revived by modern science, of the indestructibility of the universe. A
few years later (1739) he published a treatise entitled <i>The Truth of
Christianity Demonstrated by Mathematics</i>, which succeeded as might
have been expected.</p>
<p id="ch18.10" class="par">10. To the same period belong the first
activities of <span class="sc">Johann Christian Edelmann</span>
(1698&ndash;1767), one of the most energetic freethinkers of his age.
Trained philosophically at Jena under the theologian Budde, a bitter
opponent of Wolff, and theologically in the school of the Pietists, he
was strongly influenced against official orthodoxy through reading the
<i>Impartial History of the Church and of Heretics</i>, by Gottfried
Arnold, an eminently anti-clerical work, which nearly always takes the
side of the heretics.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19994src" href=
"#xd21e19994" name="xd21e19994src">70</a> In the same heterodox
direction he was swayed by the works of Dippel. At this stage Edelmann
produced his <i lang="de">Unschuldige Wahrheiten</i> (&ldquo;Innocent
Truths&rdquo;), in which he takes up a pronouncedly rationalist and
latitudinarian position, but without rejecting
&ldquo;revelation&rdquo;; and in 1736 he went to Berleburg, where he
worked on the Berleburg translation of the Bible, a Pietist
undertaking, somewhat on the lines of Dippel&rsquo;s mystical doctrine,
in which a variety of incredible Scriptural narratives, from the six
days&rsquo; creation onwards, are turned to mystical purpose.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e20014src" href="#xd21e20014" name=
"xd21e20014src">71</a> In this occupation Edelmann seems to have passed
some years. Gradually, however, he came more and more under the
influence of the English deists; and he at length withdrew from the
Pietist camp, attacking his former associates for the fanaticism into
which their thought was degenerating. It was under the influence of
Spinoza, however, that he took his most important steps. A few months
after meeting with the <i lang="la">Tractatus</i> he began (1740) the
first part of his treatise <i lang="de">Moses mit aufgedecktem
Angesichte</i> (&ldquo;Moses with unveiled face&rdquo;), an attack at
once on the doctrine of inspiration and on that of the Mosaic
authorship of the Pentateuch. The book was intended to consist of
twelve parts; but after the appearance of three it was prohibited by
the imperial fisc, and the published parts burned by the hangman at
Hamburg and elsewhere. Nonetheless, Edelmann continued his propaganda,
publishing in 1741 or 1742 <i>The Divinity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>of
Reason</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20032src" href="#xd21e20032"
name="xd21e20032src">72</a> and in 1741 <i>Christ and Belial</i>. In
1749 or 1750 his works were again publicly burned at Frankfurt by order
of the imperial authorities; and he had much ado to find anywhere in
Germany safe harbourage, till he found protection under Frederick at
Berlin, where he died in 1767.</p>
<p class="par">Edelmann&rsquo;s teaching was essentially Spinozist and
pantheistic,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20041src" href="#xd21e20041"
name="xd21e20041src">73</a> with a leaning to the doctrine of
metempsychosis. As a pantheist he of course entirely rejected the
divinity of Jesus, pronouncing inspiration the appanage of all; and the
gospels were by him dismissed as late fabrications, from which the true
teachings of the founder could not be learned; though, like nearly all
the freethinkers of that age, he estimated Jesus highly.<a class=

"xd21e20044src">74</a> A German theologian complains, nevertheless,
that he was &ldquo;more just toward heathenism than toward Judaism; and
more just toward Judaism than toward Christianity&rdquo;; adding:
&ldquo;What he taught had been thoroughly and ingeniously said in
France and England; but from a German theologian, and that with such
eloquent coarseness, with such a mastery in expatiating in blasphemy,
such things were unheard of.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e20050src" href="#xd21e20050" name="xd21e20050src">75</a> The
force of Edelmann&rsquo;s attack may be gathered from the same
writer&rsquo;s account of him as a &ldquo;bird of prey&rdquo; who rose
to a &ldquo;wicked height of opposition, not only against the Lutheran
Church, but against Christianity in general.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="ch18.11" class="par">11. Even from decorous and official
exponents of religion, however, there came &ldquo;naturalistic&rdquo;

<p id="ch18.12" class="par">12. Alongside of home-made heresy there had
come into play a new initiative force in the literature of English
deism, which began to be translated after 1740,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e20131src" href="#xd21e20131" name="xd21e20131src">83</a> and was
widely circulated till, in the last third of the century, it was
superseded by the French. The English answers to the deists were

deism<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20137src" href="#xd21e20137" name=
"xd21e20137src">84</a>&mdash;another proof that it was not their
influence that had changed the balance of activity in England. Under a
freethinking king, even clergymen began guardedly to accept the deistic
methods; and the optimism of Shaftesbury began to overlay the optimism
of Leibnitz;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20146src" href="#xd21e20146"

"#xd21e20152" name="xd21e20152src">86</a> Maupertuis, and Robinet. Even
the Leibnitzian school, proceeding on the principle of immortal monads,
developed a doctrine of the immortality of the souls of
animals<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20155src" href="#xd21e20155" name=
"xd21e20155src">87</a>&mdash;a position not helpful to orthodoxy. There
was thus a general stirring of doubt among educated people,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e20159src" href="#xd21e20159" name=
"xd21e20159src">88</a> and we find mention in Goethe&rsquo;s
Autobiography of an old gentleman of Frankfort who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=

<p class="par">On the other hand, there were instances in Germany of
the phenomenon, already seen in England in Newton and Boyle, of men of
science devoting themselves to the defence of the faith. The most
notable cases were those of the mathematician Euler and the biologist
von Haller. The latter wrote Letters (to his Daughter) <i>On the most
important Truths of Revelation</i> (1772)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e20186src" href="#xd21e20186" name="xd21e20186src">90</a> and
other apologetic works. Euler in 1747 published at Berlin, where he was
professor, his <i>Defence of Revelation against the Reproaches of
Freethinkers</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20192src" href=
"#xd21e20192" name="xd21e20192src">91</a> and in 1769 his <i>Letters to
a German Princess</i>, of which the argument notably coincides with
part of that of Berkeley against the freethinking mathematicians.
Haller&rsquo;s position comes to the same thing. All three men, in
fact, grasped at the argument of despair&mdash;the inadequacy of the
human faculties to sound the mystery of things; and all alike were
entirely unable to see that it logically cancelled their own judgments.
Even a theologian, contemplating Haller&rsquo;s theorem of an
incomprehensible omnipotence countered in its merciful plan of
salvation by the set of worms it sought to save, comments on the
childishness of the philosophy which confidently described the plans of
deity in terms of what it declared to be the blank ignorance of the
worms in question.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20201src" href=
"#xd21e20201" name="xd21e20201src">92</a> Euler and Haller, like some
later men of science, kept their scientific method for the mechanical
or physical problems of their scientific work, and brought to the
deepest problems of all the self-will, the emotionalism, and the
irresponsibility of the ignorant average man. Each did but express in
his own way the resentment of the undisciplined mind at attacks upon
its prejudices; and Haller&rsquo;s resort to poetry as a vehicle for
his religion gives the measure of his powers on that side. Thus in
Germany as in England the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; to the freethinkers was
a failure. Men of science playing at theology and theologians playing
at science alike failed to turn the tide of opinion, now socially
favoured by the known deism of the king. German orthodoxy, says a
recent Christian apologist, fell &ldquo;with a rapidity reminding one
of the capture of Jericho.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20207src"
href="#xd21e20207" name="xd21e20207src">93</a> Goethe, writing of the
general attitude to Christianity about 1768, sums up that &ldquo;the
Christian religion wavered between its own historic-positive base and a
pure deism, which, grounded on morality, was in turn to re-establish
ethics.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20210src" href="#xd21e20210"

<p class="par first">Frederick&rsquo;s attitude, said an early Kantian,
had had &ldquo;an almost magical influence&rdquo; on popular opinion
(Willich, <i>Elements of the Critical Philosophy</i>, 1798, p. 2). With
this his French teachers must have had much to do. Lord Morley
pronounces (<i>Voltaire</i>, 4th ed. p. 123) that French deism
&ldquo;never made any impression on Germany,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the
teaching of Leibnitz and Wolff stood like a fortified wall against the
French invasion.&rdquo; This is contradicted by much German testimony;
in particular by Lange&rsquo;s (<i lang="de">Gesch. des Mater.</i> i,
318), though he notes that French materialism could not get the upper
hand. Laukhard, who expressed the highest admiration for Tindal, as
having wholly delivered him from dogmatism, avowed that Voltaire, whom
everybody read, had perhaps done more harm to priest religion than all
the books of the English and German deists together (<i lang=
"de">Leben</i>, 1792&ndash;1802, Th. i, p. 268).</p>
<p class="par">Tholuck gravely affirms (<i lang="de">Abriss</i>, p. 33)
that the acquaintance with the French &ldquo;deistery and
frivolity&rdquo; in Germany belongs to a &ldquo;somewhat later period
than that of the English.&rdquo; Naturally it did. The bulk of the
English deistic literature was printed before the printing of the
French had begun! French MSS. would reach German princes, but not
German pastors. But Tholuck sadly avows that the French deism (of the
serious and pre-Voltairean portions of which he seems to have known
nothing) had a &ldquo;frightful&rdquo; influence on the upper classes,
though not on the clergy (p. 34). Following him, Kahnis writes
(<i>Internal History</i>, p. 41) that &ldquo;English and French Deism
met with a very favourable reception in Germany&mdash;the latter
chiefly in the higher circles, the former rather among the educated
middle classes.&rdquo; (He should have added, &ldquo;the younger
theologians.&rdquo;) Baur, even in speaking disparagingly of the French
as compared with the English influence, admits (<i lang="de">Lehrbuch
der Dogmengeschichte</i>, 2te Aufl. p. 347) that the former told upon
Germany. Cp. Tennemann, Bohn. tr. pp. 385, 388. Hagenbach shows great
ignorance of English deism, but he must have known something of German;
and he writes (tr. p. 57) that &ldquo;the imported deism,&rdquo; both
English and French, &ldquo;soon swept through the rifts of the Church,
and gained supreme control of literature.&rdquo; Cp. pp. 67&ndash;68.
See Croom Robertson&rsquo;s <i>Hobbes</i>, pp. 225&ndash;26, as to the
persistence of a succession of Hobbes and Locke in Germany in the teeth
of the Wolffian school, which soon lost ground after 1740. It is
further noteworthy that Brucker&rsquo;s copious <i lang="la">Historia
Critica Philosophi&aelig;</i> (1742&ndash;44), which as a mere learned
record has great merit, and was long the standard authority in Germany,
gives great praise to Locke and little space to Wolff. (See
Enfield&rsquo;s abstract, pp. 614, 619 <i>sq.</i>) The Wolffian
philosophy, too, had been rejected and disparaged by both Herder and
Kant&mdash;who were alike deeply influenced by Rousseau&mdash;in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>third quarter of the century; and was generally
discredited, save in the schools, when Kant produced the <i>Critique of
Pure Reason</i>. See below, pp. 337, 345.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p id="ch18.13" class="par">13. Frederick, though reputed a Voltairean
freethinker <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>, may be claimed for Germany
as partly a product of the rationalizing philosophy of Wolff. In his
first letter to Voltaire, written in 1736, four years before his
accession, he promises to send him a translation he has had made of the
&ldquo;accusation and the justification&rdquo; of Wolff, &ldquo;the
most celebrated philosopher of our days, who, for having carried light
into the darkest places of metaphysics, and for having treated the most
difficult matters in a manner no less elevated than precise and clear,
is cruelly accused of irreligion and atheism&rdquo;; and he speaks of
getting translated Wolff&rsquo;s <i>Treatise of God, the Soul, and the
World</i>. When he became a thoroughgoing freethinker is not clear, for
Voltaire at this time had produced no explicit anti-Christian
propaganda. At first the new king showed himself disposed to act on the
old maxim that freethought is bad for the common people. In
1743&ndash;44 he caused to be suppressed two German treatises by one
Gebhardi, a contributor to Gottsched&rsquo;s magazines, attacking the
Biblical miracles; and in 1748 he sent a young man named R&uuml;diger
to Spandau for six months&rsquo; confinement for printing an
anti-Christian work by one Dr. Pott.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e20269src" href="#xd21e20269" name="xd21e20269src">95</a> But as
he grew more confident in his own methods he extended to men of his own
way of thinking the toleration he allowed to all religionists, save
insofar as he vetoed the mutual vituperation of the sects, and such
proselytizing as tended to create strife. With an even hand he
protected Catholics, Greek Christians, and Unitarians, letting them
have churches where they would;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20275src"
href="#xd21e20275" name="xd21e20275src">96</a> and when, after the
battle of Striegau, a body of Protestant peasantry asked his permission
to slay all the Catholics they could find, he answered with the gospel
precept, &ldquo;Love your enemies.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e20278src" href="#xd21e20278" name="xd21e20278src">97</a></p>
<p class="par">Beyond the toleration of all forms of religion, however,
he never went; though he himself added to the literature of deism.
Apart from his verses we have from him the posthumous treatise <i lang=
"fr">Pens&eacute;es sur la Religion</i>, probably written early in his
life, where the rational case against the concepts of revelation and of
miracles is put with a calm and sustained force. Like the rest, he is
uncritical in his deism; but, that granted, his reasoning is
unanswerable. In talk he was wont to treat the clergy with small
respect;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20292src" href="#xd21e20292" name=
"xd21e20292src">98</a> and he wrote <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>more denunciatory
things concerning them than almost any freethinker of the
century.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20300src" href="#xd21e20300" name=
"xd21e20300src">99</a> Bayle, Voltaire, and Lucretius were his
favourite studies; and as the then crude German literature had no
attraction for him, he drew to his court many distinguished Frenchmen,
including La Mettrie, Maupertuis, D&rsquo;Alembert, D&rsquo;Argens, and
above all Voltaire, between whom and him there was an incurable
incompatibility of temper and character, and a persistent attraction of
force of mind, which left them admiring without respecting each other,
and unable to abstain from mutual vituperation. Under Frederick&rsquo;s
vigorous rule all speech was free save such as he considered personally
offensive, as Voltaire&rsquo;s attack on Maupertuis; and after a stormy
reign he could say, when asked by Prince William of Brunswick whether
he did not think religion one of the best supports of a king&rsquo;s
authority, &ldquo;I find order and the laws sufficient.... Depend upon
it, countries have been admirably governed when your religion had no
existence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20306src" href=
"#xd21e20306" name="xd21e20306src">100</a> Religion certainly had no
part in his personality in the ordinary sense of the term. Voltaire was
wont to impute to him atheism; when La Mettrie died, the mocker, then
at Frederick&rsquo;s court, remarked that the post of his
majesty&rsquo;s atheist was vacant, but happily the Abb&eacute; de
Prades was there to fill it. In effect, Frederick professed
Voltaire&rsquo;s own deism; but of all the deists of the time he had
least of the religious temperament and most of sheer cynicism.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The attempt of Carlyle to exhibit Frederick as a
practical believer is a flagrant instance of that writer&rsquo;s
subjective method. He tells (<i>Hist. of Friedrich</i>, bk. xviii, ch.
x) that at the beginning of the battle of Leuthen a column of troops
near the king sang a hymn of duty (which Carlyle calls &ldquo;the sound
of Psalms&rdquo;); that an officer asked whether the singing should be
stopped, and that the king said &ldquo;By no means.&rdquo; His
&ldquo;hard heart seems to have been touched by it. Indeed, there is in
him, in those grim days, a tone (!) as of trust in the Eternal, as of
real religious piety and faith, scarcely noticeable elsewhere in his
history. His religion&mdash;and <i>he had in withered forms a good deal
of it, if we will look well</i>&mdash;being almost always in a strictly
voiceless state, nay, ultra voiceless, or voiced the wrong way, as is
too well known.&rdquo; Then comes the assertion that &ldquo;a moment
after&rdquo; the king said &ldquo;<i>to someone, Ziethen probably</i>,
&lsquo;With men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314"
name="pb314">314</a>]</span>like these, don&rsquo;t you think I shall
have victory this day!&rsquo;&rdquo; Here, with the very spirit of
unveracity at work before his eyes, Carlyle plumps for the fable. Yet
the story, even if true, would give no proof whatever of religious
belief.</p>
<p class="par">In point of fact, Frederick was a much less
&ldquo;religious&rdquo; deist than Voltaire. He erected no temple to
his unloved God. And a perusal of his dialogue of Pompadour and the
Virgin (<i lang="fr">Dialogues des morts</i>) may serve to dispose of
the thesis that the German mind dealt reverently and decently with
matters which the French mind handled frivolously. That performance
outgoes in ribaldry anything of the age in French.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">As the first modern freethinking king, Frederick is
something of a test case. Son of a man of narrow mind and odious
character, he was himself no admirable type, being neither benevolent
nor considerate, neither truthful nor generous; and in international
politics, after writing in his youth a treatise in censure of
Machiavelli, he played the old game of unscrupulous aggression. Yet he
was not only the most competent, but, as regards home administration,
the most conscientious king of his time. To find him a rival we must go
back to the pagan Antonines and Julian, or at least to St. Louis of
France, who, however, was rather worsened than bettered by his
creed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20344src" href="#xd21e20344" name=
"xd21e20344src">101</a> Henri IV of France, who rivalled him in
sagacity and greatly excelled him in human kindness, was far his
inferior in devotion to duty.</p>
<p class="par">The effect of Frederick&rsquo;s training is seen in his
final attitude to the advanced criticism of the school of
d&rsquo;Holbach, which assailed governments and creeds with the same
unsparing severity of logic and moral reprobation. Stung by the
uncompromising attack, Frederick retorts by censuring the rashness
which would plunge nations into civil strife because kings miscarry
where no human wisdom could avoid miscarriage. He who had wantonly
plunged all Germany into a hell of war for his sole ambition, bringing
myriads to misery, thousands to violent death, and hundreds of his own
soldiers to suicide, could be virtuously indignant at the irresponsible
audacity of writers who indicted the whole existing system for its
imbecility and injustice. But he did reason on the criticism; he did
ponder it; he did feel bound to meet argument with argument; and he
left his arguments to the world. The advance on previous regal practice
is noteworthy: the whole problem of politics is at once brought to the
test of judgment and persuasion. Beside the Christian Georges and the
Louis&rsquo;s of his century, and beside his Christian father, his
superiority in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>judgment and even in some essential points of
character is signal. Such was the great deist king of the deist age; a
deist of the least religious temper and of no very fine moral material
to begin with.</p>
<p class="par">The one contemporary monarch who in any way compares
with him in enlightenment, Joseph II of Austria, belonged to the same
school. The main charge against Frederick as a ruler is that he did not
act up to the ideals of the school of Voltaire. In reply to the demand
of the French deists for an abolition of all superstitious teaching, he
observed that among the 16,000,000 inhabitants of France at most
200,000 were capable of philosophic views, and that the remaining
15,800,000 were held to their opinions by &ldquo;insurmountable
obstacles.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20356src" href=
"#xd21e20356" name="xd21e20356src">102</a> This, however, had been said
by the deists themselves (<i>e.g.</i>, d&rsquo;Holbach, pr&eacute;f. to
<i lang="fr">Christianisme d&eacute;voil&eacute;</i>); and such an
answer meant that he had no idea of so spreading instruction that all
men should have a chance of reaching rational beliefs. This attitude
was his inheritance from the past. Yet it was under him that Prussia
began to figure as a first-rate culture force in Europe.</p>
<p id="ch18.14" class="par">14. The social vogue of deistic thought
could now be traced in much of the German <i lang=
"fr">belles-lettres</i> of the time. The young <span class="sc">Jakob
von Mauvillon</span> (1743&ndash;1794), secretary of the King of Poland
and author of several histories, in his youth translated from the Latin
into French Holberg&rsquo;s <i>Voyage of Nicolas Klimius</i> (1766),
which made the tour of Europe, and had a special vogue in Germany.
Later in life, besides translating and writing abundantly and
intelligently on matters of economic and military science&mdash;in the
latter of which he had something like expert status&mdash;Mauvillon
became a pronounced heretic, though careful to keep his propaganda
anonymous.</p>
<p class="par">The most systematic dissemination of the new ideas was
that carried on in the periodical published by <span class=
"sc">Christoph Friedrich Nicolai</span> (1733&ndash;1811) under the
title of <i>The General German Library</i> (founded 1765), which began
with fifty contributors, and at the height of its power had a hundred
and thirty, among them being Lessing, Eberhard, and Moses Mendelssohn.
In the period from its start to the year 1792 it ran to 106 volumes;
and it has always been more or less bitterly spoken of by later
orthodoxy as the great library of that movement. Nicolai, himself an
industrious and scholarly writer, produced among many other things a
satirical romance famous in its day, the <i>Life and Opinions of
Magister Sebaldus Nothanker</i>, ridiculing the bigots and persecutors
the type of Klotz, the antagonist of Lessing, and some of
Nicolai&rsquo;s less <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"

id="xd21e20394src" href="#xd21e20394" name="xd21e20394src">103</a> as
well as various aspects of the general social and literary life of the
time. To Nicolai is fully due the genial tribute paid to him by
Heine,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20401src" href="#xd21e20401" name=
"xd21e20401src">104</a> were it only for the national service of his
&ldquo;Library.&rdquo; Its many translations from the English and
French freethinkers, older and newer, concurred with native work to
spread a deistic rationalism, labelled <i lang=

class of Germany.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20412src" href=
"#xd21e20412" name="xd21e20412src">105</a> Native writers in
independent works added to the propaganda. <span class="sc">Andreas

Frederick a hospital chaplain,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20418src"

against priestcraft as no other priest had yet done. &ldquo;No class of
men,&rdquo; he declared, in language perhaps echoed from his king,
&ldquo;has ever been so pernicious to the world as the priesthood.
There were laws at all times against murderers and bandits, but not
against the assassin in the priestly garb. War was repelled by war, and
it came to an end. The war of the priesthood against reason has lasted
for thousands of years, and it still goes on without
ceasing.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20421src" href="#xd21e20421"
name="xd21e20421src">107</a> <span class="sc">Georg Schade</span>
(1712&ndash;1795), who appears to have been one of the believers in the
immortality of animals, and who in 1770 was imprisoned for his opinions
in the Danish island of Christians&oelig;, was no less emphatic,
declaring, in a work on Natural Religion on the lines of Tindal (1760),
that &ldquo;all who assert a supernatural religion are godless
impostors.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20428src" href=
"#xd21e20428" name="xd21e20428src">108</a> Constructive work of great
importance, again, was done by <span class="sc">J. B. Basedow</span>
(1723&ndash;1790), who early became an active deist, but distinguished
himself chiefly as an educational reformer, on the inspiration of
Rousseau&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">&Eacute;mile</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e20439src" href="#xd21e20439" name="xd21e20439src">109</a> setting

name="xd21e20442src">110</a> and becoming in virtue of that one of the
most popular writers of his day. It is latterly admitted even by
orthodoxy that school education in Germany had in the seventeenth
century become a matter of learning by rote, and that such reforms as
had been set up in some of the schools of the Pietists had in
Basedow&rsquo;s day come to nothing.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e20449src" href="#xd21e20449" name="xd21e20449src">111</a> As
Basedow was the first to set up vigorous reforms, it is not too much to
call him an instaurator of rational education, whose chief fault was to
be too far ahead of his age. This, with the personal flaw of an
unamiable habit of wrangling in all companies, caused the failure of
his &ldquo;Philanthropic Institute,&rdquo; established in 1771, on the
invitation of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>the Prince of Dessau, to carry out his
educational ideals. Quite a number of other institutions, similarly
planned, after his lead, by men of the same way of thinking, as Canope
and Salzmann, in the same period, had no better success.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Goethe, who was clearly much impressed by Basedow,
and travelled with him, draws a somewhat antagonistic picture of him on
retrospect (<i lang="de">Wahrheit und Dichtung</i>, B. xiv). He accuses
him in particular of always obtruding his anti-orthodox opinions; not
choosing to admit that religious opinions were being constantly
obtruded on Basedow. Praising Lavater for his more amiable nature,
Goethe reveals that Lavater was constantly propounding <i>his</i>
orthodoxy. Goethe, in fine, was always lenient to pietism, in which he
had been brought up, and to which he was wont to make sentimental
concessions. He could never forget his courtly duties towards the
established convention, and so far played the game of bigotry.
Hagenbach notes (i, 298, <i>note</i>), without any deprecation, that
after Basedow had published in 1763&ndash;1764 his <i>Philalethie</i>,
a perfectly serious treatise on natural as against revealed religion,
one of the many orthodox answers, that by Pastor Goeze, so inflamed
against him the people of his native town of Hamburg that he could not
show himself there without danger. And this is the man accused of
&ldquo;obtruding his views.&rdquo; Baur is driven, by way of
disparagement of Basedow and his school, to censure their
self-confidence&mdash;precisely the quality which, in religious
teachers with whom he agreed, he as a theologian would treat as a mark

Pietist at Halle, early thought himself into a more critical
attitude,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20542src" href="#xd21e20542" name=
"xd21e20542src">120</a> albeit remaining a theological teacher. Son of
a much-travelled army chaplain, who in his many campaigns had learned
much of the world, and in particular seen something of religious frauds
in the Catholic countries, Semler started with a critical bias which
was cultivated by wide miscellaneous reading from his boyhood onwards.
As early as 1750, in his doctoral dissertation defending certain texts
against the criticism of Whiston, he set forth the view, developed a
century later by Baur, that the early Christian Church contained a
Pauline and a Petrine party, mutually hostile. The merit of his
research won him a professorship at Halle; and this position he held
till his death, despite such heresy as his rejection from the canon of
the books of Ruth, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, the Song of Solomon, the two
books of Chronicles, and the Apocalypse, in his <i lang="de">Freie
Untersuchung des Canons</i> (1771&ndash;1774)&mdash;a work apparently
inspired by the earlier performance of Richard Simon.<a class="noteref"

and he reached, for his day, a remarkably critical <span class=

towards a scientific handling of the New Testament.<a class="noteref"

<p class="par">In his latter days he strongly opposed and condemned the
more radical rationalism of his pupil Bahrdt, and of the posthumous
work of Reimarus, here exemplifying the common danger of the
intellectual life, for critical as well as uncritical minds. After
provoking many orthodox men by his own challenges, he is roused to fury
alike by the genial rationalism of Bahrdt and by the cold analysis of
Reimarus; and his attack on the Wolfenb&uuml;ttel Fragments published
by Lessing is loaded with a vocabulary of abuse such as he had never
before employed<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20595src" href="#xd21e20595"
name="xd21e20595src">128</a>&mdash;a sure sign that he had no
scientific hold of his own historical conception. Like the similarly
infuriated semi-rational defenders of the historicity of Jesus in our
own day, he merely &ldquo;followed the tactic of exposing the lack of
scientific knowledge and theological learning&rdquo; of the innovating
writer. Always temperamentally religious, he died in the evangelical
faith. But his own influence in promoting rationalism is now obvious
and unquestioned,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20598src" href=
"#xd21e20598" name="xd21e20598src">129</a> and he is rightly to be

natural religion to revelation,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;on the other hand,

"xd21e20620src">131</a> First he published (1764) <i>True Reasons why

(1766)&mdash;a form of Christianity little removed from deism. Other
theologians, such as Ernesti, went far with the tide of illuminism; and
when the orthodox Chr. A. Crusius died at Leipzig in 1781, Jean Paul
Richter, then a student, wrote that people had become &ldquo;too much
imbued with the spirit of illuminism&rdquo; to be of his school.
&ldquo;Most, almost all the students,&rdquo; adds Richter, incline to
heterodoxy; and of the professor Morus he tells that &ldquo;wherever he
can explain away a miracle, the devil, etc., he does so.&rdquo; Of this
order of accommodators, a prominent example was <span class=
"sc">Michaelis</span> (1717&ndash;1791), whose reduction of the Mosaic
legislation to motives of every-day utility is still entertaining.</p>
<p id="ch18.16" class="par">16. Much more notorious than any other
German deist of his time was <span class="sc">Carl Friedrich
Bahrdt</span> (1741&ndash;1792), a kind of raw Teutonic Voltaire, and
the most popularly influential German freethinker of his age. In all he
is said to have published a hundred and twenty-six books and
tracts,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20653src" href="#xd21e20653" name=
"xd21e20653src">135</a> thus approximating to Voltaire in quantity if
not in quality. Theological hatred has so pursued him that it is hard
to form a fair opinion as to his character; but the record runs that he
led a somewhat Bohemian and disorderly life, though a very industrious
one. While a preacher in Leipzig in 1768 he first got into
trouble&mdash;&ldquo;persecution&rdquo; by his own account;
&ldquo;disgrace for licentious conduct,&rdquo; by that of his enemies.
In any case, he was at this period quite orthodox in his
beliefs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20659src" href="#xd21e20659" name=
"xd21e20659src">136</a> That there was no serious disgrace is suggested
by the fact that he was appointed Professor of Biblical Antiquities at
Erfurt; and soon afterwards, on the recommendation of Semler and
Ernesti, at Giessen (1771). While holding that post he published his
&ldquo;modernized&rdquo; translation of the New Testament, done from
the point of view of belief in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321"
href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>revelation, following it up
by his <i>New Revelations of God in Letters and Tales</i> (1773), which
aroused Protestant hostility. After teaching for a time in a new Swiss
&ldquo;Philanthropin&rdquo;&mdash;an educational institution on
Basedow&rsquo;s lines&mdash;he obtained a post as a district
ecclesiastical superintendent in the principality of T&uuml;rkheim on
the Hardt; whereafter he was enabled to set up a
&ldquo;Philanthropin&rdquo; of his own in the castle of Heidesheim,
near Worms. The second edition of his translation of the New Testament,
however, aroused Catholic hostility in the district; the edition was
confiscated, and he found it prudent to make a tour in Holland and
England, only to receive, on his return, a missive from the imperial
consistory declaring him disabled for any spiritual office in the Holy
German Empire. Seeking refuge in Halle, he found Semler grown hostile;
but made the acquaintance of Eberhard, with the result of abandoning
the remains of his orthodox faith. Henceforth he regarded Jesus, albeit
with admiration, as simply a great teacher, &ldquo;like Moses,
Confucius, Sokrates, Semler, Luther, and myself&rdquo;;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e20668src" href="#xd21e20668" name=
"xd21e20668src">137</a> and to this view he gave effect; in the third
edition of his New Testament translation, which was followed in 1782 by
his <i>Letters on the Bible in Popular Style</i> (<i>Volkston</i>), and
in 1784 by his <i>Completion</i> (<i lang="de">Ausf&uuml;hrung</i>)
<i>of the Plan and Aim of Jesus in Letters</i> (1784), and his
<i>System of Moral Religion</i> (1787). More and more fiercely
antagonized, he duly retaliated on the clergy in his <i>Church and
Heretic Almanack</i> (1781); and after for a time keeping a tavern, he
got into fresh trouble by printing anonymous satires on the religious
edict of 1788, directed against all kinds of heresy,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e20695src" href="#xd21e20695" name="xd21e20695src">138</a> and
was sentenced to two years&rsquo; imprisonment in a fortress&mdash;a
term reduced by the king to one year. Thereafter he ended not very
happily his troublous life in Halle in 1792.</p>
<p class="par">The weakest part of Bahrdt&rsquo;s performance is now
seen to be his application of the empirical method of the early
theological rationalists, who were wont to take every Biblical prodigy
as a merely perverted account of an incident which certainly happened.
That method&mdash;which became identified with the so-called
&ldquo;rationalism&rdquo; of Germany in that age, and is not yet
discarded by rationalizing theologians&mdash;is reduced to open
absurdity in his hands, as when he makes Moses employ fireworks on
Mount Sinai, and Jesus feed the five thousand by stratagem, without
miracle. But it was not by such extravagances that he won and kept a
hearing throughout his life. It is easy to see on retrospect that the
source of his influence as a writer lay above all things in his healthy
critical ethic, his own mode of progression being by way of simple
common sense and natural <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href=
"#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>feeling, not of critical research.
His first step in rationalism was to ask himself &ldquo;how Three
Persons could be One God&rdquo;&mdash;this while believing devoutly in
revelation, miracles, the divinity of Jesus, and the Atonement. Under
the influence of a naturalist travelling in his district, he gave up
the orthodox doctrine of the Atonement, feeling himself &ldquo;as if
new-born&rdquo; in being freed of what he had learned to see as a
&ldquo;pernicious and damnable error.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e20703src" href="#xd21e20703" name="xd21e20703src">139</a> It was
for such writing that he was hated and persecuted, despite his habitual
eulogy of Christ as &ldquo;the greatest and most venerable of
mortals.&rdquo; His offence was not against morals, but against
theology; and he heightened the offence by his vanity.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Bahrdt&rsquo;s real power may be inferred from the
fury of some of his opponents. &ldquo;The wretched Bahrdt&rdquo; is Dr.
Pusey&rsquo;s Christian account of him. Even F. C. Baur is abusive. The
American translators of Hagenbach, Messrs. Gage and Stuckenberg, have
thought fit to insert in their chapter-heading the phrase
&ldquo;Bahrdt, the Theodore Parker of Germany.&rdquo; As Hagenbach has
spoken of Bahrdt with special contempt, the intention can be
appreciated; but the intended insult may now serve as a certificate of
merit to Bahrdt. Bishop Hurst solemnly affirms that &ldquo;What
Jeffreys is to the judicial history of England, Bahrdt is to the
religious history of German Protestantism. Whatever he touched was
disgraced by the vileness of his heart and the Satanic daring of his
mind&rdquo; (<i>History of Rationalism</i>, ed. 1867, p. 119; ed. 1901,
p. 139). This concerning doctrines of a nearly invariable moral
soundness, which to-day would be almost universally received with
approbation. P&uuml;njer, who cannot at any point indict the doctrines,
falls back on the professional device of classing them with the
&ldquo;platitudes&rdquo; of the <i lang="de">Aufkl&auml;rung</i>; and,
finding this insufficient to convey a disparaging impression to the
general reader, intimates that Bahrdt, connecting ethic with rational
sanitation, &ldquo;does not shrink from the coarseness of laying
down&rdquo; a rule for bodily health, which P&uuml;njer does not shrink
from quoting (pp. 549&ndash;50). Finally Bahrdt is dismissed as
&ldquo;the theological public-house-keeper of Halle.&rdquo; So hard is
it for men clerically trained to attain to a manly rectitude in their
criticism of anti-clericals. Bahrdt was a great admirer of the Gospel
Jesus; so Cairns (p. 178) takes a lenient view of his life. On that and
his doctrine cp. Hagenbach, pp. 107&ndash;10; P&uuml;njer, i,
546&ndash;50; Noack, Th. iii, Kap. 5. Goethe satirized him in a
youthful <i lang="de">Prolog</i>, but speaks of him not unkindly in the
<i lang="de">Wahrheit und Dichtung</i>. As a writer he is much above
the German average.</p>

usually considered together&mdash;<span class="sc">Gotthold Ephraim

"#xd21e20739" name="xd21e20739src">140</a> and sought, like the deists
in general, to give religion an ethical structure; but he was popular
chiefly as a constructive theist and a defender of the doctrine of
immortality on non-Christian lines. His <i>Ph&aelig;don</i> (1767),
setting forth that view, had a great vogue.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e20749src" href="#xd21e20749" name="xd21e20749src">141</a> One of

more of a German patriot than Goethe, Schiller, or Lessing. Heine,
however, pronounces that &ldquo;As Luther against the Papacy, so

<p class="par">Lessing was in fact, with his versatile genius and his
vast reading, a man of moods rather than a systematic thinker, despite
his powerful critical faculty; and alike his emotional and his critical
side determined his aversion to the attempts of the
&ldquo;rationalizing&rdquo; clergy to put religion on a common-sense
footing. His personal animosity to Voltaire and to Frederick would also
influence him; but he repugned even the decorous
&ldquo;rationalism&rdquo; of the theologians of his own country. When
his brother wrote him to the effect that the basis of the current
religion was false, and the structure the work of shallow bunglers, he
replied that he admitted the falsity of the basis, but not the
incompetence of those who built up the system, in which he saw much
skill and address. Shallow bunglers, on the other hand, he termed the
schemers of the new system of compromise and accommodation.<a class=

orthodox.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20943src" href="#xd21e20943" name=
"xd21e20943src">160</a> If all this were more than a piece of defensive
strategy, it was no more scientific than the semi-rationalist theology
which he contemned. The &ldquo;education&rdquo; theorem, on its merits,
is indeed a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>discreditable paralogism; and only our knowledge
of his affectional bias can withhold us from counting it a
mystification. On analysis it is found to have no logical content
whatever. &ldquo;Christianity&rdquo; Lessing made out to be a
&ldquo;universal principle,&rdquo; independent of its pseudo-historical
setting; thus giving to the totality of the admittedly false tradition
the credit of an ethic which in the terms of the case is simply human,
and in all essentials demonstrably pre-Christian. His propaganda of
this kind squares ill with his paper on <i>The Origin of Revealed
Religion</i>, written about 1860. There he professes to hold by a
naturalist view of religion. All &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or dogmatic
creeds he ascribes to the arrangements that men from time to time found
it necessary to make as to the means of applying &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
religion. &ldquo;Hence all positive and revealed religions are alike
true and alike false; alike true, inasmuch as it has everywhere been
necessary to come to terms over different things in order to secure
agreement and unity in the public religion; alike false, inasmuch as
that over which men came to terms does not so much stand close to the
essential (<i lang="de">nicht sowohl ... neben dem Wesentlichen
besteht</i>), but rather weakens and oppresses it. The best revealed or
positive religion is that which contains the fewest conventional
additions to natural religion; that which least limits the effects of
natural religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20954src" href=
"#xd21e20954" name="xd21e20954src">161</a> This is the position of
Tindal and the English deists in general; and it seems to have been in
this mood that Lessing wrote to Mendelssohn about being able to
&ldquo;help the downfall of the most frightful structure of nonsense

Languages in the Hamburg Academy. The famous research which preserves
his memory was begun by him at the age of fifty, for his own

Reimarus,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21027src" href="#xd21e21027" name=

name="xd21e21032src">170</a> Lessing took the course of issuing them
piecemeal in a periodical series of selections from the treasures of
the Wolfenb&uuml;ttel Library, which had privilege of publication. The
first, <i>On the Toleration of Deists</i>, which attracted little
notice, appeared in 1774; four more, which made a stir, in 1777; and
only in 1778 was &ldquo;the most audacious of all,&rdquo; <i>On the Aim
of Jesus and his Disciples</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21045src"
href="#xd21e21045" name="xd21e21045src">171</a> published as a separate
book. Collectively they constituted the most serious attack yet made in
Germany on the current creed, though their theory of the true manner of
the gospel history of course smacks of the pre-scientific period. A
generation later, however, they were still &ldquo;the radical book of
the anti-supernaturalists&rdquo; in Germany.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">As against miracles in general, the Resurrection
in particular, and Biblical ethics in general, the attack of Reimarus
was irresistible, but his historical construction is pre-scientific.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>method is, to accept as real occurrences all the
non-miraculous episodes, and to explain them by a general theory. Thus
the appointment of the seventy apostles&mdash;a palpable myth&mdash;is
taken as a fact, and explained as part of a scheme by Jesus to obtain
temporal power; and the scourging of the money-changers from the
Temple, improbable enough as it stands, is made still more so by
supposing it to be part of a scheme of insurrection. The method further
involves charges of calculated fraud against the disciples or
evangelists&mdash;a historical misconception which Lessing repudiated,
albeit not on the right grounds. See the sketch in Cairns, p. 197
<i>sq.</i>, which indicates the portions of the treatise produced later
by Strauss. Cp. P&uuml;njer, i, 550&ndash;57; Noack, Th. iii, Kap. 4.
Schweitzer (<i lang="de">Von Reimarus zu Wrede</i>), in his
satisfaction at the agreement of Reimarus with his own conception of an
&ldquo;eschatological&rdquo; Jesus, occupied with &ldquo;the last
things,&rdquo; gives Reimarus extravagant praise. Strauss rightly notes
the weakness of the indictment of Moses as a worker of fraud
(<i>Voltaire</i>, 2te Ausg. p. 407).</p>
<p class="par">It is but fair to say that Reimarus&rsquo;s fallacy of
method, which was the prevailing one in his day, has not yet
disappeared from criticism. As we have seen, it was employed by
Pomponazzi in the Renaissance (vol. i, p. 377), and reintroduced in the
modern period by Connor and Toland. It is still employed by some
professed rationalists, as Dr. Conybeare. It has, however, in all
likelihood suggested itself spontaneously to many inquirers. In the
<i>Ph&aelig;drus</i> Plato presents it as applied by empirical
rationalizers to myths at that time.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Though Lessing at many points oppugned the positions of
the <i>Fragments</i>, he was led into a fiery controversy over them, in
which he was unworthily attacked by, among others, Semler, from whom he
had looked for support; and the series was finally stopped by
authority. There can now be no doubt that Lessing at heart agreed with
Reimarus on most points of negative criticism,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21081src" href="#xd21e21081" name="xd21e21081src">173</a> but
reached a different emotional estimate and attitude. All the greater is
the merit of his battle for freedom of thought. Thereafter, as a final
check to his opponents, he produced his famous drama <i>Nathan the
Wise</i>, which embodies Boccaccio&rsquo;s story of <i>The Three
Rings</i>, and has ever since served as a popular lesson of tolerance
in Germany.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21090src" href="#xd21e21090"

name="xd21e21130src">177</a></p>
<p class="par">He left behind him, however, an important fragment,
which constituted one of his most important services to national
culture&mdash;his &ldquo;<i>New Hypothesis</i> concerning the
evangelists as merely human writers.&rdquo; He himself thought that he
had done nothing &ldquo;more important or ingenious&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e21138src" href="#xd21e21138" name=
"xd21e21138src">178</a> of the kind; and though his results were in
part unsound and impermanent, he is justly to be credited with the
first scientific attempt to deduce the process of composition of the
gospels<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21141src" href="#xd21e21141" name=
"xd21e21141src">179</a> from primary writings by the first Christians.
Holding as he did to the authenticity and historicity of the fourth
gospel, he cannot be said to have gone very deep; but two generations
were to pass before the specialists got any further. Lessing had shown
more science and more courage than any other pro-Christian scholar of
the time, and, as the orthodox historian of rationalism has it,
&ldquo;Though he did not array himself as a champion of rationalism, he
proved himself one of the strongest promoters of its
reign.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21150src" href="#xd21e21150"

far the movement had gone. In 1774 we find a Catholic professor at
Mayence, Lorenzo Isenbiehl, deposed and sent back to the seminary for
two years on the score of &ldquo;deficient theological
knowledge,&rdquo; because he argued (after Collins) that the text
Isaiah vii, 14 applied not to the mother of Jesus but to a contemporary
of the prophet; and when, four years later, he published a book on the
same thesis, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>in Latin, he was imprisoned. Three years later
still, a young Jesuit of Salzburg, named Steinbuhler, was actually
condemned to death for writing some satires on Roman Catholic
ceremonies, and, though afterwards pardoned, died of the ill-usage he
had undergone in prison.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21189src" href=
"#xd21e21189" name="xd21e21189src">184</a> It may have been the sense
of danger aroused by such persecution that led to the founding, in
1780, of a curious society which combined an element of freethinking
Jesuitism with freemasonry, and which included a number of statesmen,
noblemen, and professors&mdash;Goethe, Herder, and the Duke of Weimar
being among its adherents. But it is difficult to take seriously the
accounts given of the order.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21196src" href=

<p class="par">The spirit of rationalism, in any case, was now so
prevalent that it began to dominate the work of the more intelligent

criticism naturally most discussed among the clergy. Taking rise
broadly in the work of Semler, reinforced by that of the English and
French deists and that of Reimarus, the method led stage by stage to
the scientific performance of Strauss and Baur, and the recent
&ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo; of the Old and New Testaments.
Noteworthy at its outset as exhibiting the tendency of official
believers to make men, in the words of Lessing, irrational philosophers
by way of making them rational Christians,<a class="noteref" id=

order of &ldquo;rationalism&rdquo; in its intermediate stages belongs
rather to the history of Biblical scholarship than to that of
freethought, since more radical work was being done by unprofessional
writers outside, and deeper problems were raised by the new systems of
philosophy. Within the Lutheran pale, however, there were some hardy
thinkers. A striking figure of the time, in respect of his courage and
thoroughness, is the Lutheran pastor <span class="sc">J. H.

name="xd21e21238src">191</a> (1784) is indeed one of the most
pronounced attacks on orthodox religion produced in that age. But it is
in itself a purely speculative construction. Following the current
historical method, he makes Moses the child of the Egyptian princess,
and represents him as imposing on the ignorant Israelites a religion
invented by himself, and expressive only of his own passions. Jesus in
turn is extolled in the terms common to the freethinkers of the age;
but his conception of God is dismissed as chimerical; and Schulz
finally rests in the position of Edelmann, that the only rational
conception of deity is that of the &ldquo;sufficient ground of the
world,&rdquo; and that on this view no man is an atheist.<a class=

<p class="par">Schulz&rsquo;s dismissal appears to have been one of the
fruits of the orthodox edict (1788) of the new king, Frederick William
II, the brother of Frederick, who succeeded in 1786. It announced
him&mdash;in reality a &ldquo;strange compound of lawless debauchery
and priest-ridden superstition&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21248src" href="#xd21e21248" name=

all forms of heresy,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21254src" href=
"#xd21e21254" name="xd21e21254src">194</a> while professing to maintain
freedom of conscience. The edict seems to have been specially provoked
by fresh literature of a pronouncedly freethinking stamp, though it
lays stress on the fact that &ldquo;so many clergymen have the boldness
to disseminate the doctrines of the Socinians, Deists, and Naturalists
under the name of <i lang="de">Aufkl&auml;rung</i>.&rdquo; The work of
Schulz would be one of the provocatives, and there were others. In 1785
had appeared the anonymous <i>Moroccan Letters</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e21266src" href="#xd21e21266" name="xd21e21266src">195</a>
wherein, after the model of the <i>Persian Letters</i> and others, the
life and creeds of Germany are handled in a quite Voltairean fashion.
The writer is evidently familiar with French and English deistic
literature, and draws freely on both, making no pretence of systematic
treatment. Such writing, quietly turning a disenchanting light of
common sense on Scriptural incredibilities and Christian historical
scandals, without a trace of polemical zeal, illustrated at once the
futility of Kant&rsquo;s claim, in the second edition of his
<i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, to counteract &ldquo;freethinking
unbelief&rdquo; by transcendental philosophy. And though the writer is
careful to point to the frequent association of Christian fanaticism
with regicide, his very explicit appeal for a <span class=

would not enlist the favour of the authorities for his work. Within two
years (1787) appeared, unsigned, an even more strongly anti-Christian
and anti-clerical work, <i>The In Part Only True System of the
Christian Religion</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21295src" href=
"#xd21e21295" name="xd21e21295src">199</a> ascribed to Jakob von
Mauvillon,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21303src" href="#xd21e21303"
name="xd21e21303src">200</a> whom we have seen twenty-one years before
translating the freethinking romance of Holberg. Beginning his career
as a serious publicist by translating Raynal&rsquo;s explosive history
of the Indies (7 vols. 1774&ndash;78), he had done solid work as a
historian and as an economist, and also as an officer in the service of
the Duke of Brunswick and a writer on military science. The <i>True
System</i> is hostile alike to priesthoods and to the accommodating
theologians, whose attempt to rationalize Christianity on historical
lines it flouts in Lessing&rsquo;s vein as futile. Mauvillon finds
unthinkable the idea of a revelation which could not be universal;
rejects miracles and prophecies as vain bases for a creed; sums up the
New Testament as planless; and pronounces the ethic of Christianity,
commonly regarded as its strongest side, the weakest side of all. He
sums up, in fact, in a logical whole, the work of the English and
French deists.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21309src" href="#xd21e21309"

name="xd21e21312src">202</a> but though it ultimately failed, through
the general breakdown of European despotisms, it was not without
injurious effect. The first edict was followed in a few months by one
which placed the press and all literature, native and foreign, under
censorship. This policy, which was chiefly inspired by the new
king&rsquo;s Minister of Religion, Woellner, was followed up in 1791 by
the appointment of a committee of three reactionaries&mdash;Hermes,
Hilmer, and Woltersdorf&mdash;who not only saw to the execution of the
edicts, but supervised the schools and churches. Such a regimen, aided
by the reaction against the Revolution, for a time prevented any open
propaganda on the part of men officially placed; and we shall see it
hampering and humiliating Kant; but it left the leaven of
anti-supernaturalism to work all the more effectively among the
increasing crowd of university students. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Learning his lesson, he was for the future guarded enough to escape
persecution. He was led by his own temperamental bias, however, to a
transcendental position in philosophy. Originally in agreement with
Kant,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21343src" href="#xd21e21343" name=
"xd21e21343src">205</a> as against the current metaphysic, in the
period before the issue of the latter&rsquo;s <i>Critique of Pure
Reason</i>, he nourished his religious instincts by a discursive
reading of history, which he handled in a comparatively scientific yet
above all poetic or theosophic spirit, while Kant, who had little or no
interest in history, developed his thought on the side of physical
science.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21353src" href="#xd21e21353" name=
"xd21e21353src">206</a> The philosophic methods of the two men thus
became opposed; and when Herder found Kant&rsquo;s philosophy producing
a strongly rationalistic cast of thought among the divinity students
who came before him for examination, he directly and sharply
antagonized it<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21356src" href="#xd21e21356"
name="xd21e21356src">207</a> in a theistic sense. Yet his own influence
on his age was on the whole latitudinarian and anti-theological; he
opposed to the apriorism of Kant the view that the concepts of space
and time are the results of experience and an abstraction of its
contents; his historic studies had developed in him a conception of the
process of evolution alike in life, opinion, and faculty; and orthodoxy
and philosophy alike incline to rank him as a pantheist.<a class=

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">One passage in Goethe&rsquo;s essay on the
Pentateuch, appended to the <i lang="de">West-Oestlicher Divan</i>, is
worth noting here as illustrating the ability of genius to cherish and
propagate historical fallacies. It runs: &ldquo;The peculiar, unique,
and deepest theme of the history of the world and man, to which all
others are subordinate, is always the conflict of belief and unbelief.
All epochs in which belief rules, under whatever form, are illustrious,
inspiriting, and fruitful for that time and the future. All epochs, on
the other hand, in which unbelief, in whatever form, secures a
miserable victory, even though for a moment they may flaunt it proudly,
disappear for posterity, because no man willingly troubles himself with
knowledge of the unfruitful&rdquo; (first ed. pp. 424&ndash;25). Goethe
goes on to speak of the four latter books of Moses as occupied with the
theme of unbelief, and of the first as occupied with belief. Thus his
formula was based, to begin with, on purely fabulous history, into the
nature of which his poetic faculty gave him no true insight. (See his
idyllic recast of the patriarchal history in Th. I, B. iv of the
<i lang="de">Wahrheit und Dichtung</i>.) Applied to real history, his
formula has no validity save on a definition which implies either an
equivoque or an argument in a circle. If it refer, in the natural
sense, to epochs in which any given religion is widely rejected and
assailed, it is palpably false. The Renaissance and Goethe&rsquo;s own
century were ages of such unbelief; and they remain much more deeply
interesting than the Ages of Faith. St. Peter&rsquo;s at Rome is the
work of a reputedly unbelieving pope. If on the other hand his formula
be meant to apply to belief in the sense of energy and enthusiasm, it
is still fallacious. The crusades were manifestations of energy and
enthusiasm; but they were profoundly &ldquo;unfruitful,&rdquo; and they
are not deeply interesting. The only sense in which Goethe&rsquo;s
formula could stand would be one in which it is recognized that all
vigorous intellectual life stands for &ldquo;belief&rdquo;&mdash;that
is to say, that Lucretius and Voltaire, Paine and d&rsquo;Holbach,
stand for &ldquo;belief&rdquo; when confidently attacking beliefs. The
formula is thus true only in a strained and non-natural sense; whereas
it is sure to be read and to be believed, by thoughtless admirers, in
its natural and false <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href=
"#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>sense, though the whole history of
Byzantium and modern Islam is a history of stagnant and unfruitful
belief, and that of modern Europe a history of fruitful doubt,
disbelief, and denial, involving new affirmations. Goethe&rsquo;s own
mind on the subject was in a state of verbalizing confusion, the result
or expression of his temperamental aversion to clear analytical thought
(&ldquo;Above all,&rdquo; he boasts, &ldquo;I never thought about
thinking&rdquo;) and his habit of poetic allegory and apriorism.
&ldquo;Logic was invincibly repugnant to him&rdquo; (Lewes, <i>Life of
Goethe</i>, 3rd ed. p. 38). The mosaic of his thinking is sufficiently
indicated in Lewes&rsquo;s sympathetically confused account (<i>id.</i>
pp. 523&ndash;27). Where he himself doubted and denied current creeds,
as in his work in natural science, he was most fruitful<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e21519src" href="#xd21e21519" name=
"xd21e21519src">222</a> (though he was not always
right&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, his polemic against Newton&rsquo;s theory of
colour); and the permanently interesting teaching of his <i>Faust</i>
is precisely that which artistically utters the doubt through which he
passed to a pantheistic Naturalism.</p>

<p id="ch18.21" class="par">21. The critical philosophy of <span class=
"sc">Immanuel Kant</span> (1724&ndash;1804) may be said to represent
most comprehensively the outcome in German intelligence of the higher
freethought of the age, insofar as its results could be at all widely
assimilated. In its most truly critical part, the analytic treatment of
previous theistic systems in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> (1781),
he is fundamentally anti-theological; the effect of the argument being
to negate all previously current proofs of the existence and
cognizableness of a &ldquo;supreme power&rdquo; or deity. Already the
metaphysics of the Leibnitz-Wolff school were discredited;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e21594src" href="#xd21e21594" name=
"xd21e21594src">229</a> and so far Kant could count on a fair hearing
for a system which rejected that of the schools. Certainly he meant his
book to be an antidote to the prevailing religious credulity.
&ldquo;Henceforth there were to be no more dreams of ghost-seers,
metaphysicians, and enthusiasts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21600src" href="#xd21e21600" name="xd21e21600src">230</a> On his
own part, however, no doubt in sympathy with the attitude of many of
his readers, there followed a species of intuitional reaction. In his
short essay <i>What is Freethinking?</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21613src" href="#xd21e21613" name="xd21e21613src">231</a> (1784)
he defines <i lang="de">Aufkl&auml;rung</i> or freethinking as
&ldquo;the advance of men from their self-imputed minority&rdquo;; and
&ldquo;minority&rdquo; as the inability to use one&rsquo;s own
understanding without another&rsquo;s guidance. &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Sapere aude</i>; dare to use thine own understanding,&rdquo; he
declares to be the motto of freethought: and he dwells on the laziness
of spirit which keeps men in the state of minority, letting others do
their thinking for them as the doctor prescribes their medicine. In
this spirit he justifies the movement of rational criticism while
insisting, justly enough, that men have still far to go ere they can
reason soundly in all things. If, he observes, &ldquo;we ask whether we
live in an enlightened (<i lang="de">aufgekl&auml;rt</i>) age the
answer is, No, but in an age of enlightening (<i lang=
"de">aufkl&auml;rung</i>).&rdquo; There is still great lack of capacity
among men in general to think for themselves, free of leading-strings.
&ldquo;Only slowly can a community (<i lang="de">Publikum</i>) attain
to freethinking.&rdquo; But he repeats that &ldquo;the age is the age
of <i lang="de">aufkl&auml;rung</i>, the age of Frederick the
Great&rdquo;: and he pays a high tribute to the king who repudiated
even the arrogant pretence of &ldquo;toleration,&rdquo; and alone among
monarchs said to his subjects, &ldquo;Reason as you will; only
obey!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the element of apprehension gained ground in the
aging <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>freethinker. In 1787 appeared the second edition
of the <i>Critique</i>, with a preface avowing sympathy with religious
as against freethinking tendencies; and in the <i>Critique of Practical
Reason</i> (1788) he makes an almost avowedly unscientific attempt to
restore the reign of theism on a basis of a mere emotional and ethical
necessity assumed to exist in human nature&mdash;a necessity which he
never even attempts to demonstrate. With the magic wand of the
Practical Reason, as Heine has it, <span class="corr" id="xd21e21653"
title="Source: be">he</span> reanimated the corpse of theism, which the
Theoretic Reason had slain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21656src" href=
"#xd21e21656" name="xd21e21656src">232</a> In this adjustment he was
perhaps consciously copying Rousseau, who had greatly influenced
him,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21685src" href="#xd21e21685" name=
"xd21e21685src">233</a> and whose theism is an avowedly subjectivist
predication. But the same attitude to the problem had been
substantially adopted by Lessing;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21688src"
href="#xd21e21688" name="xd21e21688src">234</a> and indeed the process
is at bottom identical with that of the quasi-skeptics, Pascal, Huet,
Berkeley, and the rest, who at once impugn and employ the rational
process, reasoning that reason is not reasonable. Kant did but set up
the &ldquo;practical&rdquo; against the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; reason, as
other theists before him had set up faith against science, or the
&ldquo;heart&rdquo; against the &ldquo;head,&rdquo; and as theists
to-day exalt the &ldquo;will&rdquo; against &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo;
the emotional nature against the logical. It is tolerably clear that
Kant&rsquo;s motive at this stage was an unphilosophic fear that
Naturalism would work moral harm<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21697src"
href="#xd21e21697" name="xd21e21697src">235</a>&mdash;a fear shared by
him with the mass of the average minds of his age.</p>
<p class="par">The same motive and purpose are clearly at work in his
treatise on <i>Religion within the bounds of Pure</i> [<i>i.e.</i>
<i>Mere</i>] <i>Reason</i> (1792&ndash;1794), where, while insisting on
the purely ethical and rational character of true religion, he
painfully elaborates reasons for continuing to use the Bible
(concerning which he contends that, in view of its practically
&ldquo;godly&rdquo; contents, no one can deny the <i>possibility</i> of
its being held as a revelation) as &ldquo;the basis of ecclesiastical
instruction&rdquo; no less than a means of swaying the

href="#xd21e21741" name="xd21e21741src">239</a> which his ethical
purpose required. And all this divagation from the plain path of Truth
is justified in the interest of Goodness.</p>
<p class="par">All the while the book is from beginning to end
profoundly divided against itself. It indicates disbelief in every one
of the standing Christian dogmas&mdash;Creation, Fall, Salvation,
Miracles, and the supernatural basis of morals. The first paragraph of
the preface insists that morality is founded on the free reason, and
that it needs no religion to aid it. Again and again this note is
sounded. &ldquo;The pure religious faith is that alone which can serve
as basis for a universal Church; because it is a pure reason-faith, in
which everyone can participate.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21748src" href="#xd21e21748" name="xd21e21748src">240</a> But

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The process of Kant&rsquo;s adjustment of his
philosophy to social needs as he regarded them is to be understood by
following the chronology and the vogue of his writings. The first
edition of the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> &ldquo;excited little
attention&rdquo; (Stuckenberg, <i>Life of Kant</i>, p. 368); but in
1787 appeared the second and modified edition, with a new preface,
clearly written with a propitiatory eye to the orthodox reaction.
&ldquo;All at once the work now became popular, and the praise was as
loud and as fulsome as at first the silence had been profound. The
literature of the day began to teem with Kantian ideas, with
discussions of the new philosophy, and with the praises of its
author.... High officials in Berlin would lay aside the weighty affairs
of State to consider the <i lang="de">Kritik</i>, and among them were
found warm admirers of the work and its author.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> p.
369. Cp. Heine, <i lang="de">Rel. und Phil. in Deutschland</i>, B.
iii&mdash;<i lang="de">Werke</i>, iii, 75, 82. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This popularity becomes intelligible in the light of the
new edition and its preface. To say nothing of the alterations in the
text, pronounced by Schopenhauer to be cowardly accommodations (as to
which question see Adamson, as cited, and Stuckenberg, p. 461,
<i>note</i> 94), Kant writes in the preface that he had been
&ldquo;obliged to destroy knowledge in order to make room for
faith&rdquo;; and, again, that &ldquo;only through criticism can the
roots be cut of materialism, fatalism, atheism, freethinking unbelief
(<i lang="de">freigeisterischen Unglauben</i>), fanaticism and
superstition, which may become universally injurious; also of idealism
and skepticism, which are dangerous rather to the Schools, and can
hardly reach the general public.&rdquo; (Meiklejohn mistranslates:
&ldquo;which <i>are</i> universally injurious&rdquo;&mdash;Bohn ed. p.
xxxvii.) This passage virtually puts the popular religion and all
philosophies save Kant&rsquo;s own on one level of moral dubiety. It
is, however, distinctly uncandid as regards the &ldquo;freethinking
unbelief,&rdquo; for Kant himself was certainly an unbeliever in
Christian miracles and dogmas.</p>
<p class="par">His readiness to make an appeal to prejudice appears
again in the second edition of the <i>Critique</i> when he asks:
&ldquo;Whence does the freethinker derive his knowledge that there is,
for instance, no Supreme Being?&rdquo; (<i lang="de">Kritik der reinen
Vernunft, Transc. Methodenlehre</i>, 1 H. 2 <span lang=
"de">Absch.</span> ed. Kirchmann, 1879, p. 587; Bohn tr. p. 458.) He
had just before professed to be dealing with denial of the
&ldquo;existence of God&rdquo;&mdash;a proposition of no significance
whatever unless &ldquo;God&rdquo; be defined. He now without warning
substitutes the still more undefined expression &ldquo;Supreme
Being&rdquo; for &ldquo;God,&rdquo; thus imputing a proposition
probably never sustained with clear verbal purpose by any human being.
Either, then, Kant&rsquo;s own proposition was the entirely vacuous one
that nobody can demonstrate the impossibility of an alleged
<i>undefined</i> existence, or he was virtually asserting that no one
can disprove <i>any</i> alleged supernatural existence&mdash;spirit,
demon, Moloch, Krishna, Bel, Siva, Aphrodite, or Isis and Osiris. In
the latter case he would be absolutely stultifying his own claim to cut
the roots of &ldquo;superstition&rdquo; and &ldquo;fanaticism&rdquo; as
well as of freethinking and materialism; for, if the freethinker cannot
disprove Jehovah, neither can the Kantist disprove Allah and Satan; and
Kant had no basis for denying, as he did with Spinoza, the existence of
ghosts or spirits. From this dilemma Kant&rsquo;s argument cannot be
delivered. And as he finally introduces deity as a psychologically and
morally necessary regulative idea, howbeit indemonstrable, he leaves
every species of superstition exactly where it stood before&mdash;every
superstition being practically held, as against &ldquo;freethinking
unbelief,&rdquo; on just such a tenure.</p>
<p class="par">If he could thus react against freethinking before 1789,
he must needs carry the reaction further after the outbreak of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>French Revolution; and his <i lang="de">Religion
innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft</i> (1792&ndash;1794) is a
systematic effort to draw the teeth of the <i lang=
"de">Aufkl&auml;rung</i>, modified only by his resentment of the
tyranny of the political authority towards himself. Concerning the
age-long opposition between rationalism (<i lang=
"de">Verstandesaufkl&auml;rung</i>) and intuitionism or emotionalism
(<i lang="de">Gef&uuml;hlsphilosophie</i>), it is claimed by modern
transcendentalists that Kant, or Herder, or another, has effected a
solution on a plane higher than either. (<i>E.g.</i> Kronenberg,
<i lang="de">Herder&rsquo;s Philosophie</i>, 1889, p. 6.) The true
solution certainly must account for both points of view&mdash;no very
difficult matter; but no solution is really attained by either of these
writers. Kant alternately stood at the two positions; and his
unhistorical mind did not seek to unify them in a study of human
evolution. For popular purposes he let pass the assumption that a
cosmic emotion is a clue to the nature of the cosmos, as the
water-finder&rsquo;s hazel-twig is said to point to the whereabouts of
water. Herder, recognisant of evolution, would not follow out any
rational analysis.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">All the while, however, Kant&rsquo;s theism was
radically irreconcilable with the prevailing religion. As appears from
his cordial hostility to the belief in ghosts, he really lacked the
religious temperament. &ldquo;He himself,&rdquo; says a recent
biographer, &ldquo;was too suspicious of the emotions to desire to
inspire any enthusiasm with reference to his own heart.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e21834src" href="#xd21e21834" name=
"xd21e21834src">243</a> This misstates the fact that his
&ldquo;Practical Reason&rdquo; was but an abstraction of his own
emotional predilection; but it remains true that that predilection was
nearly free from the commoner forms of pious psychosis; and typical
Christians have never found him satisfactory. &ldquo;From my
heart,&rdquo; writes one of his first biographers, &ldquo;I wish that
Kant had not regarded the Christian religion merely as a necessity for
the State, or as an institution to be tolerated for the sake of the
weak (which now so many, following his example, do even in the pulpit),
but had known that which is positive, improving, and blessed in
Christianity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21840src" href=
"#xd21e21840" name="xd21e21840src">244</a> He had in fact never kept up
any theological study;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21846src" href=
"#xd21e21846" name="xd21e21846src">245</a> and his plan of compromise
had thus, like those of Spencer and Mill in a later day, a fatal
unreality for all men who have discarded theology with a full knowledge
of its structure, though it appeals very conveniently to those disposed
to retain it as a means of popular influence. All his adaptations,
therefore, failed to conciliate the mass of the orthodox; and even
after the issue of the second <i>Critique</i> (<i lang="de">Kritik der
praktischen Vernunft</i>) he had been the subject of discussion among
the reactionists.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21856src" href=
"#xd21e21856" name="xd21e21856src">246</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>But
that <i>Critique</i>, and the preface to the second edition of the
first, were at bottom only pleas for a revised ethic, Kant&rsquo;s
concern with current religion being solely ethical;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e21864src" href="#xd21e21864" name="xd21e21864src">247</a> and
the force of that concern led him at length, in what was schemed as a
series of magazine articles,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21870src" href=
"#xd21e21870" name="xd21e21870src">248</a> to expound his notion of
religion in relation to morals. When he did so he aroused a resentment
much more energetic than that felt by the older academics against his
philosophy. The title of his complete treatise, <i>Religion within the
Boundaries of Mere Reason</i>, is obviously framed to parry criticism;
yet so drastic is its treatment of its problems that the College of
Censors at Berlin under the new theological r&eacute;gime vetoed the
second part. By the terms of the law as to the censorship, the
publisher was entitled to know the reason for the decision; but on his
asking for it he was informed that &ldquo;another instruction was on
hand, which the censor followed as his law, but whose contents he
refused to make known.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21877src"
href="#xd21e21877" name="xd21e21877src">249</a> Greatly incensed, Kant
submitted the rejected article with the rest of his book to the
theological faculty of his own university of K&ouml;nigsberg, asking
them to decide in which faculty the censorship was properly vested.
They referred the decision to the philosophical faculty, which duly
proceeded to license the book (1793). As completed, it contained
passages markedly hostile to the Church. His opponents in turn were now
so enraged that they procured a royal cabinet order (October, 1794)
charging him with &ldquo;distorting and degrading many of the chief and
fundamental doctrines of the Holy Scriptures and of
Christianity,&rdquo; and ordering all the instructors at the university
not to lecture on the book.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21880src" href=
"#xd21e21880" name="xd21e21880src">250</a> Such was the reward for a
capitulation of philosophy to the philosophic ideals of the police.</p>
<p class="par">Kant, called upon to render an account of his conduct to
the Government, formally defended it, but in conclusion decorously
said: &ldquo;I think it safest, in order to obviate the least suspicion
in this respect, as your Royal Majesty&rsquo;s most faithful subject,
to declare solemnly that henceforth I will refrain altogether from all
public discussion of religion, whether natural or revealed, both in
lectures and in writings.&rdquo; After the death of Frederick William
II (1797) and the accession of Frederick William III, who suspended the
edict of 1788, Kant held himself free to speak out again, and published
(1798) an essay on &ldquo;The Strife of the [University]
Faculties,&rdquo; wherein he argued that philosophers should be free to
discuss all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>questions of religion so long as they did not
handle Biblical theology as such. The belated protest, however, led to
nothing. By this time the philosopher was incapable of further
efficient work; and when he died in 1804 the chief manuscript he left,
planned as a synthesis of his philosophic teaching, was found to be
hopelessly confused.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21887src" href=
"#xd21e21887" name="xd21e21887src">251</a></p>
<p class="par">The attitude, then, in which Kant stood to the reigning
religion in his latter years remained fundamentally hostile, from the
point of view of believing Christians as distinguished from that of
ecclesiastical opportunists. What were for temporizers arguments in
defence of didactic deceit, were for sincerer spirits fresh grounds for
recoiling from the whole ecclesiastical field. Kant must have made more
rebels than compliers by his very doctrine of compliance. Religion was
for him essentially ethic; and there is no reconciling the process of
propitiation of deity, in the Christian or any other cult, with his
express declaration that all attempts to win God&rsquo;s favour save by
simple right-living are sheer fetichism.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21892src" href="#xd21e21892" name="xd21e21892src">252</a> He thus
ends practically at the point of view of the deists, whose influence on
him in early life is seen in his work on cosmogony.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e21899src" href="#xd21e21899" name="xd21e21899src">253</a> He
had, moreover, long ceased to go to church or follow any religious
usage, even refusing to attend the services on the installation of a
new university rector, save when he himself held the office. At the
close of his treatise on religion, after all his anxious
accommodations, he becomes almost violent in his repudiations of
sacerdotalism and sectarian self-esteem. &ldquo;He did not like the
singing in the churches, and pronounced it mere bawling. In prayer,
whether public or private, he had not the least faith; and in his
conversation as well as his writings he treated it as a superstition,
holding that to address anything unseen would open the way for
fanaticism. Not only did he argue against prayer; he also ridiculed it,
and declared that a man would be ashamed to be caught by another in the
attitude of prayer.&rdquo; One of his maxims was that &ldquo;To kneel
or prostrate himself on the earth, even for the purpose of symbolizing
to himself reverence for a heavenly object, is unworthy of
man.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21902src" href="#xd21e21902"
name="xd21e21902src">254</a> So too he held that the doctrine of the
Trinity had no practical value, and he had a &ldquo;low opinion&rdquo;
of the Old Testament.</p>
<p class="par">Yet his effort at compromise had carried him to
positions which are the negation of some of his own most emphatic
ethical teachings. Like Plato, he is finally occupied in discussing the
&ldquo;right fictions&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href=
"#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>for didactic purposes. Swerving
from thoroughgoing freethought for fear of moral harm, he ends by
sacrificing intellectual morality to what seems to him social security.
His doctrine, borrowed from Lessing, of a &ldquo;conceivable&rdquo;
revelation which told man only what he could find out for himself, is a
mere flout to reason. While he carries his &ldquo;categorical
imperative,&rdquo; or &agrave; priori conception of duty, so
extravagantly far as to argue that it is wrong even to tell a falsehood
to a would-be murderer in order to mislead him, he approves of the
systematic employment of the pulpit function by men who do not believe
in the creed they there expound. The priest, with Kant&rsquo;s
encouragement, is to &ldquo;draw all the practical lessons for his
congregation from dogmas which he himself cannot subscribe with a full
conviction of their truth, but which he can teach, since it is not
altogether impossible that truth may be concealed therein,&rdquo; while
he remains free as a scholar to write in a contrary sense in his own
name. And this doctrine, set forth in the censured work of 1793, is
repeated in the moralist&rsquo;s last treatise (1798), wherein he
explains that the preacher, when speaking doctrinally, &ldquo;can put
into the passage under consideration his own rational views, whether
found there or not.&rdquo; Kant thus ended by reviving for the
convenience of churchmen, in a worse form, the medieval principle of a
&ldquo;twofold truth.&rdquo; So little efficacy is there in a
transcendental ethic for any of the actual emergencies of life.</p>

&ldquo;Kant&rsquo;s recognition of Scripture is purely a matter of
expedience. The State needs the Bible to control the people; the masses
need it in order that they, having weak consciences, may recognize
their duty; and the philosopher finds it a convenient vehicle for
conveying to the people the faith of reason. Were it rejected it might
be difficult, if not impossible, to put in its place another book which
would inspire as much confidence.&rdquo; All the while
&ldquo;Kant&rsquo;s principles of course led him to deny that the Bible
is authoritative in matters of religion, or that it is of itself a safe
guide in morals.... Its value consists in the fact that, owing to the
confidence of the people in it, reason can use it to interpret into
Scripture its own doctrines, and can thus <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>make it the means of
popularizing rational faith. If anyone imagines that the aim of the

Kantian on this point&rdquo; (Stuckenberg, p. 341).</p>

<p id="ch18.22" class="par">22. The total performance of Kant thus left
Germany with a powerful lead on the one hand towards that unbelief in
religion which in the last reign had been fashionable, and on the other
hand a series of prescriptions for compromise; the monarchy all the
while throwing its weight against all innovation in doctrine and
practice. In 1799 Fichte is found expressing the utmost alarm at the
combination of the European despotisms to &ldquo;rout out
freethought&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21936src" href=
"#xd21e21936" name="xd21e21936src">255</a> and so strong did the
official reaction become that in the opinion of Heine all the German
philosophers and their ideas would have been suppressed by wheel and
gallows but for Napoleon,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21939src" href=
"#xd21e21939" name="xd21e21939src">256</a> who intervened in the year
1805. The Prussian despotism being thus weakened, what actually
happened was an adaptation of Kant&rsquo;s teaching to the needs alike
of religion and of rationalism. The religious world was assured by it
that, though all previous arguments for theism were philosophically
worthless, theism was now safe on the fluid basis of feeling. On the
other hand, rationalism alike in ethics and in historical criticism was
visibly reinforced on all sides. Herder, as before noted, found
divinity students grounding their unbelief on Kant&rsquo;s teaching.
Sta&uuml;dlin begins the preface to his <i>History and Spirit of
Skepticism</i> (1794) with the remark that &ldquo;Skepticism begins to
be a disease of the age&rdquo;; and Kant is the last in his list of
skeptics. At the close of the century &ldquo;the number of Kantian
theologians was legion,&rdquo; and it was through the Kantian influence
that &ldquo;the various anti-orthodox tendencies which flourished
during the period of Illumination were concentrated in
Rationalism&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21950src" href=
"#xd21e21950" name="xd21e21950src">257</a>&mdash;in the tendency, that
is, to bring rational criticism to bear alike on history, dogma, and
philosophy. Borowski in 1804 complains that &ldquo;beardless youths and
idle babblers&rdquo; devoid of knowledge &ldquo;appeal to Kant&rsquo;s
views respecting Christianity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21953src" href="#xd21e21953" name="xd21e21953src">258</a> These
views, as we have seen, were partly accommodating, partly subversive in
the extreme. Kant regards Jesus as an edifying ideal of perfect
manhood, &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in whom as such makes a man acceptable to
God, because of following a good model. &ldquo;While he thus treats the
historical account of Jesus as of no significance, except as a shell
into which the practical reason puts the kernel, his whole argument
tends to destroy faith <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href=
"#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span>in the historic person of Jesus as
given in the gospel, treating the account itself as something whose
truthfulness it is not worth while to investigate.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e21961src" href="#xd21e21961" name=
"xd21e21961src">259</a> In point of fact we find his devoted disciple
Erhard declaring: &ldquo;I regard Christian morality as something which
has been falsely imputed to Christianity; and the existence of Christ
does not at all seem to me to be a probable historical
fact&rdquo;&mdash;this while declaring that Kant had given him
&ldquo;the indescribable comfort of being able to call himself openly,
and with a good conscience, a Christian.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21970src" href="#xd21e21970" name="xd21e21970src">260</a></p>
<p class="par">While therefore a multitude of preachers availed
themselves of Kant&rsquo;s philosophic licence to rationalize in the
pulpit and out of it as occasion offered, and yet others opposed them
only on the score that all divergence from orthodoxy should be avowed,
the dissolution of orthodoxy in Germany was rapid and general; and the
anti-supernaturalist handling of Scripture, prepared for as we have
seen, went on continuously. Even the positive disparagement of
Christianity was carried on by Kantian students; and Hamann, dubbed
&ldquo;the Magician of the North&rdquo; for his alluring exposition of
emotional theism, caused one of them, a tutor, to be brought before a
clerical consistory for having taught his pupil to throw all
specifically Christian doctrines aside. The tutor admitted the charge,
and with four others signed a declaration &ldquo;that neither morality
nor sound reason nor public welfare could exist in connection with
Christianity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21978src" href=
"#xd21e21978" name="xd21e21978src">261</a> Hamann&rsquo;s own influence
was too much a matter of literary talent and caprice to be durable; and
recent attempts to re-establish his reputation have evoked the
deliberate judgment that he has no permanent importance.<a class=

"xd21e21981src">262</a></p>
<p class="par">Against the intellectual influence thus set up by Kant
there was none in contemporary Germany capable of resistance.
Philosophy for the most part went in Kant&rsquo;s direction, having
indeed been so tending before his day. Rationalism of a kind had
already had a representative in Chr. A. Crusius (1712&ndash;1775), who
in treatises on logic and metaphysics opposed alike Leibnitz and Wolff,
and taught for his own part a kind of Epicureanism, nominally
Christianized. To his school belonged Platner (much admired by Jean
Paul Richter, his pupil) and Tetens, &ldquo;the German Locke,&rdquo;
who attempted a common-sense answer to Hume. His ideal was a philosophy
&ldquo;at once intelligible and religious, agreeable to God and
accessible to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347"
name="pb347">347</a>]</span>people.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21994src" href="#xd21e21994" name="xd21e21994src">263</a> Platner
on the other hand, leaning strongly towards a psychological and
anthropological view of human problems,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e22000src" href="#xd21e22000" name="xd21e22000src">264</a> opposed

"xd21e22011src">266</a> a moderate Pyrrhonic skepticism; here following
a remarkable lead from the younger Beausobre, who in 1755 had published
in French, at Berlin, a treatise entitled <i lang="fr">Le Pyrrhonisme
Raisonnable</i>, taking up the position, among others, that while it is
hard to prove the existence of God by reason it is impossible to
disprove it. This was virtually the position of Kant a generation
later; and it is clear that thus early the dogmatic position was
discredited.</p>
<p id="ch18.23" class="par">23. Some philosophic opposition there was
to Kant, alike on intuitionist grounds, as in the cases of Hamann and
Herder, and on grounds of academic prejudice, as in the case of Kraus;
but the more important thinkers who followed him were all as heterodox
as he. In particular, <span class="sc">Johann Gottlieb Fichte</span>
(1762&ndash;1814), who began in authorship by being a Kantian zealot,
gave even greater scandal than the Master had done. Fichte&rsquo;s
whole career is a kind of &ldquo;abstract and brief chronicle&rdquo; of
the movements of thought in Germany during his life. In his boyhood, at
the public school of Pforta, we find him and his comrades already
influenced by the new currents. &ldquo;Books imbued with all the spirit
of free inquiry were secretly obtained, and, in spite of the strictest
prohibitions, great part of the night was spent in their perusal. The
works of Wieland, Lessing, and Goethe were positively forbidden; yet
they found their way within the walls, and were eagerly
studied.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22025src" href="#xd21e22025"
name="xd21e22025src">267</a> In particular, Fichte followed closely the
controversy of Lessing with Goeze; and Lessing&rsquo;s lead gave him at
once the spirit of freethought, as distinct from any specific opinion.
Never a consistent thinker, Fichte in his student and tutorial days is
found professing at once determinism and a belief in
&ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; accepting Spinoza and contemplating a village
pastorate.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22031src" href="#xd21e22031"
name="xd21e22031src">268</a> But while ready to frame a plea for
Christianity on the score of its psychic adaptation to &ldquo;the
sinner,&rdquo; he swerved from the pastorate when it came within sight,
declaring that &ldquo;no purely Christian community now
exists.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22036src" href="#xd21e22036"
name="xd21e22036src">269</a> About the age of twenty-eight he became an
enthusiastic convert to the Kantian philosophy, especially to the
<i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>, and threw over determinism on what
appear to be grounds of empirical utilitarianism, failing to face the
philosophical issue. Within a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348"
href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>year of his visit to Kant,
however, he was writing to a friend that &ldquo;Kant has only indicated
the truth, but neither unfolded nor proved it,&rdquo; and that he
himself has &ldquo;discovered a new principle, from which all
philosophy can easily be deduced.... In a couple of years we shall have
a philosophy with all the clearness of geometrical
demonstration.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22047src" href=
"#xd21e22047" name="xd21e22047src">270</a> He had in fact passed,
perhaps under Spinoza&rsquo;s influence, to pantheism, from which
standpoint he rejected Kant&rsquo;s anti-rational ground for affirming
a God not immanent in things, and claimed, as did his contemporaries
Schelling and Hegel, to establish theism on rational grounds.
Rejecting, further, Kant&rsquo;s reiterated doctrine that religion is
ethic, Fichte ultimately insisted that, on the contrary, religion is
knowledge, and that &ldquo;it is only a <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e22050" title="Source: currupt">corrupt</span> society that has to
use religion as an impulse to moral action.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But alike in his Kantian youth and later he was
definitely anti-revelationist, however much he conformed to clerical
prejudice by attacks upon the movement of freethought. In his
&ldquo;wander-years&rdquo; he writes with vehemence of the &ldquo;worse
than Spanish inquisition&rdquo; under which the German clergy are
compelled to &ldquo;cringe and dissemble,&rdquo; partly because of lack
of ability, partly through economic need.<a class="noteref" id=

<i lang="de">Versuch einer Kritik aller Offenbarung</i> (&ldquo;Essay
towards a Critique of all Revelation&rdquo;), published with some
difficulty, Kant helping (1792), he in effect negates the orthodox
assumption, and, in the spirit of Kant and Lessing, but with more
directness than they had shown, concludes that belief in revelation
&ldquo;is an element, and an important element, in the moral education
of humanity, but it is not a final stage for human
thought.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22063src" href="#xd21e22063"
name="xd21e22063src">272</a> In Kant&rsquo;s bi-frontal fashion, he had
professed<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22069src" href="#xd21e22069" name=
"xd21e22069src">273</a> to &ldquo;silence the opponents of positive
religion not less than its dogmatical defenders&rdquo;; but that result
did not follow on either side, and ere long, as a professor at Jena, he
was being represented as one of the most aggressive of the opponents.
Soon after producing his <i>Critique of all Revelation</i> he had
published anonymously two pamphlets vindicating the spirit as
distinguished from the conduct of the French Revolution; and upon a
young writer known to harbour such ideas enmity was bound to fall. Soon
it took the form of charges of atheism. It does not appear to be true
that he ever told his students at Jena: &ldquo;In five years there will
be no more Christian religion: reason is our religion&rdquo;;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e22076src" href="#xd21e22076" name=

purely malicious.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22084src" href=
"#xd21e22084" name="xd21e22084src">275</a> But his career henceforth
was one of strife and friction, first with the student-blackguardism
which had been rife in the German universities ever since the Thirty
Years&rsquo; War, and which he partly subdued; then with the academic
authorities and the traditionalists, who, when he began lecturing on
Sunday mornings, accused him of attempting to throw over Christianity
and set up the worship of reason. He was arraigned before the High
Consistory of Weimar and acquitted; but his wife was insulted in the
streets of Jena; his house was riotously attacked in the night; and he
ceased to reside there. Then, in his <i lang=
"de">Wissenschaftslehre</i> (&ldquo;Doctrine of Knowledge,&rdquo;
1794&ndash;95) he came into conflict with the Kantians, with whom his
rupture steadily deepened on ethical grounds. Again he was accused of
atheism in print; and after a defence in which he retorted the charge
on the utilitarian theists he resigned.</p>
<p class="par">In Berlin, where the new king held the old view that the
wrongs of the Gods were the Gods&rsquo; affair, he found harbourage;
and sought to put himself right with the religious world by his book
<i lang="de">Die Bestimmung des Menschen</i> (&ldquo;The Vocation of
Man,&rdquo; 1800), wherein he speaks of the Eternal Infinite Will as
regulating human reason so far as human reason is right&mdash;the old
counter-sense and the old evasion. By this book he repelled his
rationalistic friends Schelling and the Schlegels; while his religious
ally Schleiermacher, who chose another tactic, wrote on it a bitter and
contemptuous review, and &ldquo;could hardly find words strong enough
to express his detestation of it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

into sympathy with his countrymen, from whom he had turned away in
angry alienation, he remained a philosophic Ishmael, warring and warred
upon all round. He was thus left to figure for posterity as a
religionist &ldquo;for his own hand,&rdquo; who rejected all current
religion while angrily dismissing current unbelief as
&ldquo;freethinking chatter.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e22107src" href="#xd21e22107" name="xd21e22107src">277</a> If his
philosophy be estimated by its logical content as distinguished from
its conflicting verbalisms, it is fundamentally as atheistic as that of
Spinoza.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22112src" href="#xd21e22112" name=
"xd21e22112src">278</a> That he was conscious of a vital sunderance
between his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>thought and that of the past is made clear by
his answer, in 1805, to the complaint that the people had lost their
&ldquo;religious feeling&rdquo; (<i lang="de">Religiosit&auml;t</i>).
His retort is that a new religious feeling has taken the place of the
old;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22139src" href="#xd21e22139" name=
"xd21e22139src">279</a> and that was the position taken up by the
generation which swore by him, in the German manner, as the last had
sworn by Kant.</p>
<p class="par">But the successive philosophies of Kant, Fichte,
Schelling, and Hegel, all rising out of the &ldquo;Illumination&rdquo;
of the eighteenth century, have been alike impermanent. Nothing is more
remarkable in the history of thought than the internecine strife of the
systems which insisted on &ldquo;putting something in the place&rdquo;
of the untenable systems of the past. They have been but so many
&ldquo;toppling spires of cloud.&rdquo; Fichte, like Herder, broke away
from the doctrine of Kant; and later became bitterly opposed to that of
his former friend Schelling, as did Hegel in his turn. Schleiermacher,
hostile to Kant, was still more hostile to Fichte; and Hegel, detesting
Schleiermacher<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22146src" href="#xd21e22146"
name="xd21e22146src">280</a> and developing Fichte, give rise to
schools arrayed against each other, of which the anti-Christian was by
far the stronger. All that is permanent in the product of the age of
German Rationalism is the fundamental principle upon which it
proceeded, the confutation of the dogmas and legends of the past, and
the concrete results of the historical, critical, and physical research
to which the principle and the confutation led.</p>
<p id="ch18.24" class="par">24. It is true that the progressive work
was not all done by the Rationalists so-called. As always, incoherences
in the pioneers led to retorts which made for rectification. One of the
errors of bias of the early naturalists, as we have noted, was their
tendency to take every religious document as genuine and at bottom
trustworthy, provided only that its allegations of miracles were
explained away as misinterpretations of natural phenomena. So satisfied
were many of them with this inexpensive method that they positively
resisted the attempts of supernaturalists, seeking a way out of
<i>their</i> special dilemma, to rectify the false ascriptions of the
documents. Bent solely on one solution, they were oddly blind to
evidential considerations which pointed to interpolation, forgery,
variety of source, and error of literary tradition; while scholars bent
on saving &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; were often ready in some measure
for such recognitions. These arrests of insight took place alternately
on both sides, in the normal way of intellectual progress by alternate
movements. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>All the while, it is the same primary force of
reason that sets up the alternate pressures, and the secondary
pressures are generated by, and are impossible without, the first.</p>
<p id="ch18.25" class="par">25. The emancipation, too, was limited in
area in the German-speaking world. In Austria, despite a certain amount
of French culture, the rule of the Jesuits in the eighteenth century
was too effective to permit of any intellectual developments. Maria
Theresa, who knew too well that the boundless sexual licence against
which she fought had nothing to do with innovating ideas, had to issue
a special order to permit the importation of Montesquieu&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr">Esprit des Lois</i>; and works of more subversive doctrine
could not openly pass the frontiers at all. An attempt to bring Lessing
to Vienna in 1774, with a view to founding a new literary Academy,
collapsed before the opposition; and when Prof. Jahn, of the Vienna
University&mdash;described as &ldquo;freethinking, latitudinarian,
anti-supernaturalistic&rdquo;&mdash;developed somewhat anti-clerical
tendencies in his teaching and writing, he was forced to resign, and
died a simple Canon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22164src" href=

href="#xd21e22173" name="xd21e22173src">282</a> but there was no

pleasure.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22179src" href=
"#xd21e22179" name="xd21e22179src">283</a> Yet among the music-makers
was the German-born <span class="sc">Beethoven</span>, the greatest
master of his age. Kindred in spirit to Goethe, and much more of a
revolutionist than he in all things, Beethoven spent the creative part
of his life at Vienna without ceasing to be a freethinker.<a class=

ancient formulas: &ldquo;I am that which is&rdquo;: &ldquo;I am all

and to Him alone do all things owe their being.&rdquo; Beyond this his
beliefs did not go. When his friend Moscheles at the end of his
arrangement of <i>Fidelio</i> wrote: &ldquo;<i>Fine</i>, with
God&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; Beethoven added, &ldquo;O man, help
thyself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22204src" href="#xd21e22204"

Pufendorf&rsquo;s bulky treatise <i lang="la">De Jure Natur&aelig; et
Gentium</i> was published at Lund, where he was professor, in 1672. The
shorter <i lang="la">De Officio hominis et civis</i> (also Lund, 1673)
is a condensation and partly a vindication of the other, and this it
was that convinced Thomasius. As to Pufendorf&rsquo;s part in the
transition from theological to rational moral philosophy, see Hallam,
<i>Lit. of Europe</i>, iv, 171&ndash;78. He is fairly to be bracketed
with Cumberland; but Hallam hardly recognizes that it was the challenge
of Hobbes that forced the change.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Translated into English 1780; 2nd ed. 1793. The translator claims for
Haller great learning (2nd ed. p. xix). He seems in reality to have had
very little, as he represents that Jesus in his day &ldquo;was the only
teacher who recommended chastity to men&rdquo; (p. 82).&nbsp;<a class=

Carlyle naturally detests Thi&eacute;bault. The rumour may have arisen
out of the fact that in his <i lang="fr">Examen critique du

Lessing&rsquo;s life were sketched in the spirit in which orthodoxy has
handled that of Bahrdt, it could be made unedifying enough. Even Goethe
remarks that Lessing &ldquo;enjoyed himself in a disorderly tavern
life&rdquo; (<i lang="de">Wahrheit und Dichtung</i>, B. vii); and all
that Hagenbach maliciously charges against Basedow in the way of
irregularity of study is true of him. On that and other points, usually
<span class="corr" id="xd21e20798" title=
"Source: glosed">glossed</span> over, see the sketch in Taylor&rsquo;s
<i>Historic Survey of German Poetry</i>, 1830, i, 332&ndash;37. All the
while, Lessing is an essentially sound-hearted and estimable
personality; and he would probably have been the last man to echo the
tone of the orthodox towards the personal life of the freethinkers who
went further in unbelief than he.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<i>Prometheus</i> that, according to Jacobi, drew from Lessing
<i>his</i> avowal of a pantheistic leaning. The poem has even an
atheistic ring; but we have Goethe&rsquo;s own account of the influence
of Spinoza on him from his youth onwards (<i lang="de">Wahrheit und

Kant explicitly concurs in Warburton&rsquo;s thesis that the Jewish
lawgiver purposely omitted all mention of a future state from the
Pentateuch; since such belief must be supposed to have been current in
Jewry. But he goes further, and pronounces that simple Judaism contains
&ldquo;absolutely no religious belief.&rdquo; To this complexion can

hostility to Nature, as lifeless, godless, and altogether unholy, while
his religion consisted in the assumption of a mere <i lang="la">ordo

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Holland, so notable for relative hospitality to
freethinking in the seventeenth century, continued to exhibit it in the
eighteenth, though without putting forth much native response. After
her desperate wars with Louis XIV, the Dutch State, now monarchically
ruled, turned on the intellectual side rather to imitative <i lang=
"fr">belles lettres</i> than to the problems which had begun to
exercise so much of English thought. It was an age of
&ldquo;retrogression and weakness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e22228src" href="#xd21e22228" name="xd21e22228src">1</a> Elizabeth
Wolff, <i lang="fr">n&eacute;e</i> Bekker, one of the most famous of
the numerous Dutch women-writers of the century (1738&ndash;1804), is
notable for her religious as well as for her political
liberalism;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22237src" href="#xd21e22237"
name="xd21e22237src">2</a> but her main activity was in novel-writing;
and there are few other signs of freethinking tendencies in popular
Dutch culture. It was impossible, however, that the influences at work
in the neighbouring lands should be shut out; and if Holland did not
produce innovating books she printed many throughout the century.</p>
<p class="par">In 1708 there was published at Amsterdam a work under
the pseudonym of &ldquo;Juan di Posos,&rdquo; wherein, by way of a
relation of imaginary travels, something like atheism was said to be
taught; but the pastor Leenhof had in 1703 been accused of atheism for
his treatise, <i>Heaven on Earth</i>, which was at most
Spinozistic.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22247src" href="#xd21e22247"
name="xd21e22247src">3</a> Even as late as 1714 a Spinozist shoemaker,
<span class="sc">Booms</span>, was banished for his writings; but
henceforth liberal influences, largely traceable to the works of Bayle,
begin to predominate. Welcomed by students everywhere, Bayle must have
made powerfully for tolerance and rationalism in his adopted country,
which after his time became a centre of culture for the States of
northern Europe rather than a source of original works. Holland in the
eighteenth century was receptive alike of French and English thought
and literature, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353"

id="xd21e22261src" href="#xd21e22261" name="xd21e22261src">4</a> and,
besides reprinting many of the French deists&rsquo; works and
translating some of the English, the Dutch cities harboured such
heretics as the Italian Alberto Radicati, Count <span class=
"sc">Passerano</span>, who, dying at Rotterdam in 1736, left a
collection of deistic treatises of a strongly freethinking cast to be
posthumously published.</p>
<p class="par">The German traveller Alberti,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e22273src" href="#xd21e22273" name="xd21e22273src">5</a> citing
the <i>London Magazine</i>, 1732, states that Passerano visited England
and published works in English through a translator, Joseph Morgan, and
that both were sentenced to imprisonment. This presumably refers to his
anonymous <i>Philosophical Dissertation upon Death</i>, &ldquo;by a
friend to truth,&rdquo; published in English in 1732.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e22284src" href="#xd21e22284" name="xd21e22284src">6</a> It is
a remarkable treatise, being a hardy justification of suicide,
&ldquo;composed for the consolation of the unhappy,&rdquo; from a
practically atheistic standpoint. Two years earlier he had published in
English, also anonymously, a tract entitled <i>Christianity set in a
True Light, by a Pagan Philosopher newly converted</i>; and it may be
that the startling nature of the second pamphlet elicited a prosecution
which included both. The pamphlet of 1730, however, is a eulogy of the
ethic of Jesus, who is deistically treated as a simple man, but with
all the amenity which the deists usually brought to bear on that theme.
Passerano&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Recueil des pi&egrave;ces curieuses sur

Edward Elwall, a well-known Unitarian of the time, who, as we saw, was
tried at Stafford Assizes in 1726 for publishing a Unitarian treatise,
and who in 1742 published another, entitled <i>The Supernatural
Incarnation of Jesus Christ proved to be false ... and that our Lord
Jesus Christ was the real son of Joseph and Mary</i>. The two tracts
are both by Passerano, and are on deistic lines, the text of the
<i>Sermon</i> being (in English) &ldquo;The Religion of the Gospel is
the true Original Religion of Reason and Nature.&rdquo; The proposition
is of course purely ethical in its bearing.</p>

<p class="par">The currency given in Holland to such literature tells
of growing liberality of thought as well as of political freedom. But
the conditions were not favourable to such general literary activity as
prevailed in the larger States, though good work was done in medicine
and the natural sciences. Not till the nineteenth century did Dutch
scholars again give a lead to Europe in religious thought.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch19.2.1" class="par first">1. Traces of new rationalistic life
are to be seen in the Scandinavian countries at least as early as the
times of Descartes. There, as elsewhere, the Reformation had been
substantially a fiscal or economic revolution, proceeding on various
lines. In Denmark the movement, favoured by the king, began among the
people; the nobility rapidly following, to their own great profit; and
finally Christian III, who ruled both Denmark and Norway, acting with
the nobles, suppressed Catholic worship, and confiscated to the crown
the &ldquo;castles, fortresses, and vast domains of the
prelates.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22357src" href=
"#xd21e22357" name="xd21e22357src">11</a> In Sweden the king, Gustavus
Vasa, took the initiative, moved by sore need of funds, and a
thoroughly anti-ecclesiastical temper,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e22375src" href="#xd21e22375" name="xd21e22375src">12</a> the
clergy having supported the Danish rule which he threw off. The
burghers and peasants promptly joined him against the clergy and
nobles, enabling him to confiscate the bishops&rsquo; castles and
estates, as was done in Denmark; and he finally secured himself with
the nobles by letting them reclaim lands granted by their ancestors to
monasteries.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22381src" href="#xd21e22381"
name="xd21e22381src">13</a> His anti-feudal reforms having stimulated
new life in many ways, further evolution followed.</p>
<p class="par">In Sweden the stimulative reign of Gustavus Vasa was
followed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>by a long period of the strife which everywhere
trod on the heels of the Reformation. The second successor of Gustavus,
his son John, had married a daughter of the Catholic Sigismund of
Poland, and sought to restore her religion to power, causing much
turmoil until her death, whereafter he abandoned the cause. His
Catholic son Sigismund recklessly renewed the effort, and was deposed
in consequence; John&rsquo;s brother Charles becoming king. In Denmark,
meanwhile, Frederick II (d. 1588) had been a bigoted champion of
Lutheranism, expelling a professor of Calvinistic leanings on the
Eucharist, and refusing a landing to the Calvinists who fled from the
Netherlands. On the other hand he patronized and pensioned Tycho

of Sweden, as Protestant champion in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, in
succession to Christian IV of Denmark, fills the eye of Europe till his
death in 1632; eleven years after which event Sweden and Denmark were
again at war. In 1660 the latter country, for lack of goodwill between
nobles and commoners, underwent a political revolution whereby its
king, whose predecessors had held the crown on an elective tenure,
became absolute, and set up a hereditary line. The first result was a
marked intellectual stagnation. &ldquo;Divinity, law, and philosophy
were wholly neglected; surgery was practised only by barbers; and when
Frederick IV and his queen required medical aid, no native physician
could be found to whom it was deemed safe to entrust the cure of the

astronomy can boast, is that of Peter Horrebow, and with him the

peopled by moving trees and civilized and socialized animals. With the

precaution is slight, as they are declared to have practically no
dogmas at all. It is thus easy to read between the lines of the
declaration of Potuan orthodoxy: &ldquo;Formerly our ancestors
contented themselves to live in natural religion alone; but experience

some reflex of the intellectual renascence. Towards the middle of the
seventeenth century there are increasing traces of rationalism at the
court of the famous Christina, who already in her youth is found much
interested in the objections of &ldquo;Jews, heathens, and philosophers
against Christian doctrine&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22466src"
href="#xd21e22466" name="xd21e22466src">24</a> and her invitation of
Descartes to her court (1649) implies that Sweden had been not a little
affected by the revulsion of popular thought which followed on the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War in Germany. Christina herself, however, was a
remarkable personality, unfeminine, strong-willed, with a vigorous but
immature intelligence; and she did much of her early skeptical thinking
for herself. In the course of a few years, the new spirit had gone so
far as to make church-going matter for open scoffing at the Swedish
court;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22469src" href="#xd21e22469" name=

which she prepared by abdicating the crown, appears to have been by way
of revulsion from a state of mind approaching atheism, to which she had
been led by her freethinking French physician, Bourdelot, after
Descartes&rsquo;s death.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22474src" href=
"#xd21e22474" name="xd21e22474src">26</a> It has been confidently

always unhappy in her Swedish surroundings. But her course may more
reasonably be explained as that of a mind which could not rest in deism
or face atheism, and sought in Catholicism the sense of anchorage which
is craved by temperaments ill-framed for the discipline of reason. The
author of the <i lang="fr">Histoire des intrigues galantes de la reine
Christine de Su&egrave;de</i> (1697), who seems to have been one of her
suite, insists that while she &ldquo;loved bigots no more than
atheists,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22487src" href=

<p class="par">Her annotations of Descartes are of little importance;

German Pufendorf, indeed, by his treatises <i>On the Law of Nature and

Lund, where he was professor, in 1672&ndash;73), did much to establish
the utilitarian and naturalistic tendency in ethics which was at work
at the same time in England; but his latent deism had no great
influence even in Germany, his Scripture-citing orthodoxy
countervailing it, although he argued for a separation of Church and
State.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22515src" href="#xd21e22515" name=

<p id="ch19.2.4" class="par">4. That there was, however, in
eighteenth-century Sweden a considerable amount of unpublished
rationalism may be gathered from the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg,
himself something of a freethinker in his very supernaturalism. His
frequent subacid allusions to those who &ldquo;regarded Nature instead
of the divine,&rdquo; and &ldquo;thought from science,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e22523src" href="#xd21e22523" name=
"xd21e22523src">33</a> tell not merely of much passive opposition to
his own prophetic claims (which he avenged by much serene malediction
and the allotment of bad quarters in the next world), but of reasoned
rejection of all Scriptural claims. Thus in his <i lang="la">Sapientia
Angelica de Divina Providentia</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e22530src"
href="#xd21e22530" name="xd21e22530src">34</a> (1764) he sets
himself<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22536src" href="#xd21e22536" name=
"xd21e22536src">35</a> to deal with a number of the ways in which
&ldquo;the merely natural man confirms himself in favour of Nature
against God&rdquo; and &ldquo;comes to the conclusion that religion in
itself is nothing, but yet that it is necessary because it serves as a
restraint.&rdquo; Among the sources of unbelief specified are ethical
revolt alike against the Biblical narratives and against the lack of
moral government in the world; the recognition of the success of other
religions than the Christian, and of the many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>heresies within that; and dissatisfaction with
the Christian dogmas. As Swedenborg sojourned much in other countries,
he may be describing men other than his countrymen; but it is very
unlikely that the larger part of his intercourse with his fellows
counted for nothing in this account of contemporary rationalism.</p>
<p class="par">With his odd mixture of scripturalism and innovating
dogmatism, Swedenborg disposes of difficulties about Genesis by
reducing Adam and Eve to an allegory of the &ldquo;Most Ancient
Church,&rdquo; tranquilly dismissing the orthodox belief by asking,
&ldquo;For who can suppose that the creation of the world could have
been as there described?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22543src"
href="#xd21e22543" name="xd21e22543src">36</a> His own scientific
training, which had enabled him to make his notable anticipation of the
nebular theory,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22546src" href="#xd21e22546"
name="xd21e22546src">37</a> made it also easy for him to reduce to
allegory the text of what he nevertheless insisted on treating as a
divine revelation; and his moral sense, active where he felt no
perverting resentment of contradiction by reasoners,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e22554src" href="#xd21e22554" name="xd21e22554src">38</a> made
him reject the orthodox doctrine of salvation by faith, even as he did
the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. On these points he seems to have
had a lead from his father, Bishop Jasper Svedberg,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e22560src" href="#xd21e22560" name="xd21e22560src">39</a> as he
had in his overwhelming physiological bias to subjective vision-making.
But a message which finally amounted to the oracular propounding of a
new and bewildering supernaturalism, to be taken on authority like the
old, could make for freethought only by rousing rational reaction. It
was Swedenborg&rsquo;s destiny to establish, in virtue of his great
power of orderly dogmatism, a new supernaturalist and scripturalist
sect, while his scientific conceptions were left for other men to
develop. In his own country, in his own day, he had little success
<i>qua</i> prophet, though always esteemed for his character and his
high secular competence; and he finally figured rather as a heresiarch
than otherwise.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22570src" href="#xd21e22570"

<p id="ch19.2.5" class="par">5. According to one of Swedenborg&rsquo;s
biographers, the worldliness of most of the Swedish clergy in the
middle of the eighteenth century so far outwent even that of the
English Church that the laity were left to themselves; while
&ldquo;gentlemen disdained the least taint of religion, and except on
formal occasions would have been ashamed to be caught
church-going.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22578src" href=
"#xd21e22578" name="xd21e22578src">41</a> But this was a matter rather
of fashion than of freethought; and there is little trace of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=

of the eighteenth century, doubtless, the aristocracies and the

everywhere followed the vogue of the French language and literature.
Thus we find Gustavus III of Sweden, an ardent admirer of Voltaire,
defending him in company, and proposing in 1770, before the death of
his father prevented it, to make a pilgrimage to Ferney.<a class=

an indifferentist. During his reign his influence on literature
fostered a measure of the spirit of freethought in <i lang="fr">belles

d. 1795) there is to be seen the effect of the German <i lang=

contemporary, Tomas Thoren, who called himself Torild (d. 1812), though
more of an innovator in poetic style than in thought, wrote among other
things a pamphlet on <i>The Freedom of the General Intelligence</i>.
But Torild&rsquo;s nickname, &ldquo;the mad <i>magister</i>,&rdquo;
tells of his extravagance; and none of the Swedish belletrists of that
age amounted to a European influence. Finally, in the calamitous period
which followed on the assassination of Gustavus III, all Swedish
culture sank heavily. The desperate energies of Charles XII had left
his country half-ruined in 1718; and even while Linn&aelig;us and his
pupils were building up the modern science of botany in the latter half
of the century the economic exhaustion of the people was a check on
general culture. The University of Upsala, which at one time had over
2,000 students, counted only some 500 at the close of the eighteenth
century.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22642src" href="#xd21e22642" name=

<p id="ch19.2.6" class="par">6. In Denmark, on the other hand, the
stagnation of nearly a hundred years had been ended at the accession of
Frederick V in 1746.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22649src" href=
"#xd21e22649" name="xd21e22649src">51</a> National literature,
revivified by Holberg, was further advanced by the establishment of a
society of polite learning in 1763; under Frederick&rsquo;s auspices
Danish naturalists and scholars were sent abroad for study; and in
particular a literary expedition was sent to Arabia. The European
movement of science, in short, had gripped the little kingdom, and the
usual intellectual results began to follow, though, as in Catholic
Spain, the forces of reaction soon rallied against a movement which had
been imposed from above rather than evolved from within.</p>
<p class="par">The most celebrated northern unbeliever of the French
period was Count Struensee, who for some years (1770&ndash;72)
virtually ruled Denmark as the favourite of the young queen, the king
being half-witted and worthless. Struensee was an energetic and capable
though injudicious reformer: he abolished torture; emancipated the
enslaved peasantry; secured toleration for all sects; encouraged the
arts and industry; established freedom of the press; and reformed the
finances, the police, the law courts, and sanitation.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e22654src" href="#xd21e22654" name="xd21e22654src">52</a> His
very reforms, being made with headlong rapidity, made his position
untenable, and his enemies soon effected his downfall and death. The
young queen, who was not alleged to have been a freethinker, was
savagely seized by the hostile faction and put on her trial on a charge
of adultery, which being wholly unproved, the aristocratic faction
proposed to try her on a charge of drugging her husband. Only by the
efforts of the British court was she saved from imprisonment for life
in a fortress, and sent to Hanover, where, three years later, she died.
She too was a reformer, and it was on that score that she was hated by
the nobles.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22659src" href="#xd21e22659"
name="xd21e22659src">53</a> Both she and Struensee, in short, were the
victims of a violent political reaction. There is an elaborate account
of Struensee&rsquo;s conversion to Christianity in prison by the German
Dr. Munter,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22665src" href="#xd21e22665"
name="xd21e22665src">54</a> which makes him out by his own confession
an excessive voluptuary. It is an extremely suspicious document,
exhibiting strong political bias, and giving Struensee no credit for
reforms; the apparent assumption being <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb362" href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>that the conversion
of a reprobate was of more evidential value than that of a reputable
and reflective type.</p>
<p class="par">In spite of the reaction, rationalism persisted among
the cultured class. Mary Wollstonecraft, visiting Denmark in 1795,
noted that there and in Norway the press was free, and that new French
publications were translated and freely discussed. The press had in
fact been freed by Struensee, and was left free by his enemies because
of the facilities it had given them to attack him.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e22675src" href="#xd21e22675" name="xd21e22675src">55</a>
&ldquo;On the subject of religion,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;they are
likewise becoming tolerant, at least, and perhaps have advanced a step
further in freethinking. One writer has ventured to deny the divinity
of Jesus Christ, and to question the necessity or utility of the
Christian system, without being considered universally as a monster,
which would have been the case a few years ago.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e22678src" href="#xd21e22678" name=
"xd21e22678src">56</a> She likewise noted that there was in Norway very
little of the fanaticism she had seen gaining ground, on Wesleyan
lines, in England.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22681src" href=
"#xd21e22681" name="xd21e22681src">57</a> But though the Danes had
&ldquo;translated many German works on education,&rdquo; they had
&ldquo;not adopted any of their plans&rdquo;; there were few schools,
and those not good. Norway, again, had been kept without a university
under Danish rule; and not until one was established at Christiania in
1811 could Norwegian faculty play its part in the intellectual life of
Europe. The reaction, accordingly, soon afterwards began to gain head.
Already in 1790 &ldquo;precautionary measures&rdquo; had been attempted
against the press;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22686src" href=
"#xd21e22686" name="xd21e22686src">58</a> and, these being found
inefficient, an edict was issued in 1799 enforcing penalties against
all anonymous writers&mdash;a plan which of course struck at the
publishers. But the great geographer, Malte-Brun, was exiled, as were
Heiberg, the dramatic poet, and others; and again there was &ldquo;a
temporary stagnation in literature,&rdquo; which, however, soon passed
away in the nineteenth century. Meantime Sweden and Denmark had alike
contributed vitally to the progress of European science; though neither
had shared in the work of freethought as against dogma.</p>

struggling out of Byzantine barbarism. The late-recovered treasure of
ancient folk-poesy, partly preserved by chance among the northern
peasantry, tells of the complete rupture wrought in the racial life by
the imposition of Byzantine Christianity from the south. As early as
the fourteenth century the Strigolniks, who abounded at Novgorod, had
held strongly by anti-ecclesiastical doctrines of the Paulician and
Lollard type;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22718src" href="#xd21e22718"

ecclesiastical; and in the seventeenth century the effort of the
turbulent Patriarch Nikon (1605&ndash;1681), to correct the corrupt
sacred texts and the traditional heterodox practices, was furiously
resisted, to the point of a great schism.<a class="noteref" id=

the friends of the new light doubtless included deists from the first.
Not till the reforms of Peter had begun to bear fruit, however, could
freethought raise its head. The great Czar, who promoted printing and

the singular step of actually withdrawing writing materials from the

and constituting him its salaried keeper. In no country, not excepting

<p id="ch19.4.1" class="par first">1. Returning to Italy, no longer the
leader of European thought, but still full of veiled freethinking, we
find in the seventeenth century the proof that no amount of such
predisposition can countervail thoroughly bad political conditions.
Ground down by the matchless misrule of Spain, from which the
conspiracy of the monk Campanella vainly sought to free her, and by the
kindred tyranny of the papacy, Italy could produce in its educated
class, save for the men of science and the students of economics, only
triflers, whose unbelief was of a piece with their cynicism. While
Naples and the south decayed, mental energy had for a time flourished
in Tuscany, where, under the grand dukes from Ferdinando I onwards,
industry and commerce had revived; and even after a time of
retrogression Ferdinando II encouraged science, now made newly glorious
by the names of Galileo and Torricelli. But again there was a relapse;
and at the end of the century, under a bigoted duke, Florence was
priest-ridden and, at least in outward seeming, gloomily superstitious;
while, save for the better conditions secured at Naples under the
viceroyalty of the Marquis of Carpi,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e22815src" href="#xd21e22815" name="xd21e22815src">77</a> the rest
of Italy was cynically corrupt and intellectually superficial.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e22821src" href="#xd21e22821" name=
"xd21e22821src">78</a> Even in Naples, of course, enlightenment was
restricted to the few. Burnet observes that &ldquo;there are societies
of men at Naples of freer thoughts than can be found in any other place
of Italy&rdquo;; and he admits a general tendency of intelligent
Italians to recoil from Christianity by reason of Catholic corruption.
But at the same time he insists that, though the laity speak with scorn
of the clergy, &ldquo;yet they are masters of the spirits of the
people.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22830src" href="#xd21e22830"
name="xd21e22830src">79</a> Yet it only needed the breathing time and
the improved conditions under the Bourbon rule in the eighteenth
century to set up a wonderful intellectual revival.</p>
<p id="ch19.4.2" class="par">2. First came the great work of
<span class="sc">Vico</span>, the <i>Principles of a New <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>Science</i> (1725), whereof the originality and
the depth&mdash;qualities in which, despite its incoherences, it on the
whole excels Montesquieu&rsquo;s <i>Spirit of Laws</i>&mdash;place him
among the great freethinkers in philosophy. It was significant of much
that Vico&rsquo;s book, while constantly using the vocabulary of faith,
grappled with the science of human development in an essentially
secular and scientific spirit. This is the note of the whole eighteenth
century in Italy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22846src" href=
"#xd21e22846" name="xd21e22846src">80</a> Vico posits Deity and
Providence, but proceeds nevertheless to study the laws of civilization
inductively from its phenomena. He permanently obscured his case,
indeed, by insisting on putting it theologically, and condemning
Grotius and others for separating the idea of law from that of
religion. Only in a pantheistic sense has Vico&rsquo;s formula any
validity; and he never avows a pantheistic view, refusing even to go
with Grotius in allowing that Hebrew law was akin to that of other
nations. But a rationalistic view, had he put it, would have been
barred. The wonder is, in the circumstances, not that he makes so much
parade of religion, but that he could venture to undermine so vitally
its pretensions, especially after he had found it prudent to renounce
the project of annotating the great work of Grotius, <i lang="la">De
Jure Belli et Pacis</i>, on the score that (as he puts it in his
Autobiography) a good Catholic must not endorse a heretic.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Signor Benedetto Croce, in his valuable work on
Vico (<i>The Philosophy of Giambattista Vico</i>, Eng. tr. 1913, pp.
89&ndash;94), admits that Vico is fundamentally at one with the
Naturalists: &ldquo;Like them, in constructing his science of human
society, he excludes with Grotius all idea of God, and with Pufendorf
considers man as without help or attention from God, excluding him,
that is, from revealed religion and its God.&rdquo; Of Vico&rsquo;s
opposition to Grotius, Signor Croce offers two unsatisfactory
explanations. First: &ldquo;Vico&rsquo;s opposition, which he expresses
with his accustomed confusion and obscurity, turns ... upon the actual
conception of religion.... Religion ... means for Vico not necessarily
revelation, but conception of reality.&rdquo; This reduces the defence
to a quibble; but finally Signor Croce asks himself &ldquo;Why&mdash;if
Vico agreed with the natural-right school in ignoring revelation, and
if he instead of it deepened their superficial immanental
doctrine&mdash;why he put himself forward as their implacable enemy and
persisted in boasting loudly before prelates and pontiffs of having
formulated a system of natural rights different from that of the three
Protestant authors and adapted to the Roman Church.&rdquo; The natural
suggestion of &ldquo;politic caution&rdquo; Signor Croce rejects,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>declaring that &ldquo;the spotless character of
Vico entirely precludes it; and we can only suppose that, <i>lacking as
his ideas always were in clarity</i>, on this occasion he <i>indulged
his tendency to confusion and nourished his illusions</i>, to the
extent of conferring upon himself the flattering style and title of
<i lang="la">Defensor Ecclesi&aelig;</i> at the very moment when he was
destroying the religion of the Church by means of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It is very doubtful whether this equivocal vindication
is more serviceable to Vico&rsquo;s fame than the plain avowal that a
writer placed as he was, in the Catholic world of 1720, could not be
expected to be straightforward upon such an issue. Vico comported
himself towards the Catholic Church very much as Descartes did. His own
declaration as to his motives is surely valid as against a formula
which combines &ldquo;spotless character&rdquo; with a cherished
&ldquo;tendency to confusion.&rdquo; The familiar &ldquo;tendency to
hedge&rdquo; is a simpler conception.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p id="ch19.4.3" class="par">3. It is noteworthy, indeed, that the
&ldquo;New Science,&rdquo; as Vico boasted, arose in the Catholic and
not in the Protestant world. We might say that, genius apart, the
reason was that the energy which elsewhere ran to criticism of religion
as such had in Catholic Italy to take other channels. By attacking a
Protestant position which was really less deeply heterodox than his
own, Vico secured Catholic currency for a philosopheme which on its own
merits Catholic theologians would have scouted as atheism. As it was,
Vico&rsquo;s sociology aroused on the one hand new rationalistic
speculation as to the origin of civilization, and on the other orthodox
protest on the score of its fundamentally anti-Biblical character. It
was thus attacked in 1749 by Damiano Romano, and later by Finetti, a
professor at Padua, &agrave;propos of the propaganda raised by
Vico&rsquo;s followers as to the animal origin of the human race. This
began with Vico&rsquo;s disciple, Emmanuele Duni, a professor at Rome,
who published a series of sociological essays in 1763. Thenceforth for
many years there raged, &ldquo;under the eyes of Pope and
cardinals,&rdquo; an Italian debate between the <i>Ferini</i> and
<i>Antiferini</i>, the affirmers and deniers of the animal origin of
man, the latter of course taking up their ground on the Bible, from
which Finetti drew twenty-three objections to Vico.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e22884src" href="#xd21e22884" name="xd21e22884src">81</a> Duni
found it prudent to declare that he had &ldquo;no intention of
discussing the origin of the world, still less that of the Hebrew
nation, but solely that of the Gentile nations&rdquo;; but even when
thus limited the debate set up far-reaching disturbance. At this stage
Italian sociology doubtless owed something to Montesquieu and Rousseau;
but the fact remains that the <i lang="it">Scienza Nuova</i> was a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>book &ldquo;truly Italian; Italian <i lang=
"fr">par excellence</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22899src"
href="#xd21e22899" name="xd21e22899src">82</a> It was Vico, too, who
led the way in the critical handling of early Roman history, taken up
later by Beaufort, and still later by Niebuhr; and it was he who began
the scientific analysis of Homer, followed up later by F. A.
Wolf.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22902src" href="#xd21e22902" name=
"xd21e22902src">83</a> By a fortunate coincidence, the papal chair was
held at the middle of the century (1740&ndash;1758) by the most
learned, tolerant, and judicious of modern popes, Benedict
XIV,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22911src" href="#xd21e22911" name=
"xd21e22911src">84</a> whose influence was used for political peace in
Europe and for toleration in Italy; and whom we shall find, like
Clement XIV, on friendly terms with a freethinker. In the same age
Muratori and Giannone amassed their unequalled historical learning; and
a whole series of Italian writers broke new ground on the field of
social science, Italy having led the way in this as formerly in
philosophy and physics.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22925src" href=
"#xd21e22925" name="xd21e22925src">85</a> The Hanoverian Dr. G. W.

records that according to capable observers the effect of the French
freethinking literature in the past thirty years had been immense,
especially in Tuscany.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22959src" href=

<p id="ch19.4.4" class="par">4. Between 1737 and 1798 may be counted
twenty-eight Italian writers on political economy; and among them was
one, <span class="sc">Cesare Beccaria</span>, who on another theme
produced perhaps the most practically influential single book of the
eighteenth century,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22972src" href=
"#xd21e22972" name="xd21e22972src">88</a> the treatise on <i>Crimes and
Punishments</i> (1764), which affected penal methods for the better
throughout the whole of Europe. Even were he not known to be a deist,
his strictly secular and rationalist method would have brought upon him
priestly suspicion; and he had in fact to defend himself against
pertinacious and unscrupulous attacks,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e22981src" href="#xd21e22981" name="xd21e22981src">89</a> though
he had sought in his book to guard himself by occasionally
&ldquo;veiling the truth in clouds.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e22996src" href="#xd21e22996" name="xd21e22996src">90</a> As we
have seen, Beccaria owed his intellectual awakening first to
Montesquieu and above all to Helv&eacute;tius&mdash;another testimony
to the reformative virtue of all freethought. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Of the aforesaid eight-and-twenty writers on economics,
probably the majority were freethinkers. Among them, at all events,
were Count <span class="sc">Algarotti</span> (1712&ndash;1764), the
distinguished &aelig;sthetician, one of the group round Frederick at
Berlin and author of <i lang="it">Il Newtonianismo per le dame</i>
(1737); <span class="sc">Filangieri</span>, whose work on legislation
(put on the <i>Index</i> by the papacy) won the high praise of
Franklin; the Neapolitan <i lang="fr">abbate</i> <span class=
"sc">Ferdinando Galiani</span>, one of the brightest and soundest wits
in the circle of the French <i lang="fr">philosophes</i>; the other
Neapolitan <i lang="fr">abbate</i> <span class="sc">Antonio
Genovesi</span> (1712&ndash;1769), the &ldquo;redeemer of the Italian
mind,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23034src" href="#xd21e23034"
name="xd21e23034src">91</a> and the chief establisher of economic
science for modern Italy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23037src" href=
"#xd21e23037" name="xd21e23037src">92</a> To these names may be added
those of <span class="sc">Alfieri</span>, one of the strongest
anti-clericalists of his age; <span class="sc">Bettinelli</span>, the
correspondent of Voltaire and author of <i>The Resurrection of
Italy</i> (1775); Count <span class="sc">Dandolo</span>, author of a
French work on <i>The New Men</i> (1799); and the learned <span class=
"sc">Giannone</span>, author of the great anti-papal <i>History of the
Kingdom of Naples</i> (1723), who, after more than one narrow escape,
was thrown in prison by the king of Sardinia, and died there (1748)
after twelve years&rsquo; confinement.</p>
<p class="par">To the merits of Algarotti and Genovesi there are high
contemporary testimonies. Algarotti was on friendly terms with Cardinal
Ganganelli, who in 1769 became Pope Clement XIV. In 1754 the latter
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23071src" href="#xd21e23071" name=
"xd21e23071src">93</a> him: &ldquo;My dear Count, Contrive matters so,
in spite of your philosophy, that I may see you in heaven; for I should
be very sorry to lose sight of you for an eternity. You are one of
those rare men, both for heart and understanding, whom we could wish to
love even beyond the grave, when we have once had the advantage of
knowing them. No one has more reasons to be convinced of the
spirituality and immortality of the soul than you have. The years glide
away for the philosophers as well as for the ignorant; and what is to
be the term of them cannot but employ a man who thinks. Own that I can
manage sermons so as not to frighten away a <i lang="fr">bel
esprit</i>; and that if every one delivered as short and as friendly
sermons as I do, you would sometimes go to hear a preacher. But barely
hearing will not do ... the amiable Algarotti must become as good a
Christian as he is a philosopher: then should I doubly be his friend
and servant.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23080src" href=
"#xd21e23080" name="xd21e23080src">94</a></p>
<p class="par">In an earlier letter, Ganganelli writes: &ldquo;The Pope
[Benedict XIV] is ever great and entertaining for his <i lang="fr">bons
mots</i>. He was saying the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href=
"#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>other day that he had always loved
you, and that it would give him very great pleasure to see you again.
He speaks with admiration of the king of Prussia ... whose history will
make one of the finest monuments of the eighteenth century. See here
and acknowledge my generosity! For that prince makes the greatest jest
possible of the Court of Rome, and of us monks and friars. Cardinal
Querini will not be satisfied unless he have you with him for some time
at Brescia. He one day told me that he would invite you to come and
dedicate his library.... There is no harm in preaching to a philosopher
who seldom goes to hear a sermon, and who will not have become a great
saint by residing at Potsdam. You are there three men whose talents
might be of great use to religion if you would change their
direction&mdash;viz. Yourself, Mons. de Voltaire, and M. de Maupertuis.
But that is not the <i lang="fr">ton</i> of the age, and you are
resolved to follow the fashion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23096src" href="#xd21e23096" name="xd21e23096src">95</a>
Ganganelli in his correspondence reveals himself as an admirer of
Newton<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23099src" href="#xd21e23099" name=
"xd21e23099src">96</a> and somewhat averse to religious zeal.<a class=

"xd21e23103src">97</a> Of the papal government he admitted that it was
favourable &ldquo;neither to commerce, to agriculture, nor to
population, which precisely constitute the essence of public
felicity,&rdquo; while suavely reminding the Englishman of the
&ldquo;inconveniences&rdquo; of his own government.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e23106src" href="#xd21e23106" name="xd21e23106src">98</a> To

<p class="par">But Ganganelli&rsquo;s own thinking on the issues
between reason and religion was entirely commonplace.
&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;departs from the account given
of the Creation in the book of Genesis has nothing to support it but
paradoxes, or, at most, mere hypotheses. Moses alone, as being an
inspired author, could perfectly acquaint us with the formation of the
world, and the development of its parts.... Whoever does not see the
truth in what Moses relates was never born to know it.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e23114src" href="#xd21e23114" name=
"xd21e23114src">100</a> It was only in his relation to the bigots of
his own Church that his thinking was rationalistic. &ldquo;The
Pope,&rdquo; he writes to a French marquis, &ldquo;relies on
Providence; but God does not perform miracles every time he is asked to
do it. Besides, is he to perform one that Rome may enjoy a right of
seignory over the Duchy of Parma?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23117src" href="#xd21e23117" name="xd21e23117src">101</a> At his
death an Italian wrote of him that &ldquo;the distinction he was able
to draw between dogmas or discipline and ultramontane opinions gave him
the courage to take many opportunities <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>of promoting the
peace of the State.&rdquo; His tolerance is sufficiently exhibited in
one of his letters to Algarotti: &ldquo;I hope that you will preach to
me some of these days, so that each may have his turn.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e23122src" href="#xd21e23122" name=
"xd21e23122src">102</a> Freethought had achieved something when a Roman
Cardinal, a predestinate Pope, could so write to an avowed freethinker.
Concerning Galiani we have the warm panegyric of Grimm. &ldquo;If I
have any vanity with which to reproach myself,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;it is that which I derive in spite of myself from the fact of
the conformity of my ideas with those of the two rarest men whom I have
the happiness to know, Galiani and Denis Diderot.&rdquo;<a class=

would have satisfied him and Grimm was not to be published in that
age.</p>
<p class="par">Italy, however, had done her full share, considering her
heritage of burdens and hindrances, in the intellectual work of the
century; and in the names of Galvani and Volta stands the record of one
more of her great contributions to human enlightenment. Under Duke
Leopold II of Tuscany the papacy was so far defied that books put on
the <i>Index</i> were produced for him under the imprint of
London;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23135src" href="#xd21e23135" name=
"xd21e23135src">104</a> and the papacy itself at length gave way to the
spirit of reform, Clement XIV consenting among other things to abolish
the Order of Jesuits (1773), after his predecessor had died of grief
over his proved impotence to resist the secular policy of the States
around him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23138src" href="#xd21e23138"
name="xd21e23138src">105</a> In Tuscany, indeed, the reaction against
the French Revolution was instant and severe. Leopold succeeded his
brother Joseph as emperor of Austria in 1790, but died in 1792; and in
his realm, as was the case in Denmark and in Spain in the same century,
the reforms imposed from above by a liberal sovereign were found to
have left much traditionalism untouched. After 1792, Ferdinando III
suspended some of his father&rsquo;s most liberal edicts, amid the
applause of the reactionaries; and in 1799, after the first short stay
of the revolutionary French army, out of its one million inhabitants no
fewer than 22,000 were prosecuted for &ldquo;French
opinions.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23141src" href=
"#xd21e23141" name="xd21e23141src">106</a> Certainly some of the
&ldquo;French opinions&rdquo; were wild enough; for instance, the
practice among ladies of dressing <i lang="it">alla ghigliottina</i>,
with a red ribbon round the neck, a usage borrowed about 1795 from
France.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23151src" href="#xd21e23151" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch19.5.1" class="par first">1. For the rest of Europe during the
eighteenth century, we have to note only traces of receptive thought.
Spain under Bourbon rule, as already noted, experienced an
administrative renascence. Such men as Count <span class=
"sc">Aranda</span> (1718&ndash;99) and Aszo y del Rio (1742&ndash;1814)
wrought to cut the claws of the Inquisition and to put down the
Jesuits; but not yet, after the long work of destruction accomplished
by the Church in the past, could Spain produce a fresh literature of
any far-reaching power. When Aranda was about to be appointed in 1766,
his friends the French <i lang="fr">Encyclop&eacute;distes</i>
prematurely proclaimed their exultation in the reforms he was to
accomplish; and he sadly protested that they had thereby limited his
possibilities.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23178src" href="#xd21e23178"
name="xd21e23178src">109</a> Nonetheless he wrought much, the power of
the Inquisition in Spain being already on the wane. Dr. Joaquin
Villanueva, one of the ecclesiastical statesmen who took part in its
suppression by the Cortes at Cadiz in 1813, tells how, in his youth,
under the reign of Charles III, it was a current saying among the
students at college that while the clever ones could rise to important
posts in the Church, or in the law, the blockheads would be sure to
find places in the Inquisition.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23184src"
href="#xd21e23184" name="xd21e23184src">110</a> It was of course still
powerful for social terrorism and minor persecution; but its power of
taking life was rapidly dwindling. Between 1746 and 1759 it had burned
only ten persons; from 1759 until 1781 it burned only four; thereafter
none,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23190src" href="#xd21e23190" name=
"xd21e23190src">111</a> the last case having provoked protests which
testified to the moral change wrought in Europe by a generation of
freethought.</p>
<p class="par">In Spain too, as elsewhere, freethought had made way
among the upper classes; and in 1773 we find the Duke d&rsquo;Alba
(formerly Huescar), ex-ambassador of Spain to France, subscribing
eighty louis for a statue to Voltaire. &ldquo;Condemned to cultivate my
reason in secret,&rdquo; he wrote to D&rsquo;Alembert, &ldquo;I see
this opportunity to give a public testimony of my gratitude to and
admiration for the great man who first showed me the
way.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23201src" href="#xd21e23201"
name="xd21e23201src">112</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href=
"#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch19.5.2" class="par">2. Still all freethinking in Spain ran
immense risks, even under Charles III. The Spanish admiral Solano was
denounced by his almoner to the Inquisition for having read Raynal, and
had to demand pardon on his knees of the Inquisition and God.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e23207src" href="#xd21e23207" name=
"xd21e23207src">113</a> Aranda himself was from first to last four
times arraigned before the Inquisition,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23213src" href="#xd21e23213" name="xd21e23213src">114</a>
escaping only by his prestige and power. So eminent a personage as P.
A. J. Olavid&egrave;s, known in France as the Count of Pilos
(1726&ndash;1803), could not thus escape. He had been appointed by
Charles III prefect of Seville, and had carried out for the king the
great work of colonizing the Sierra Morena,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23216src" href="#xd21e23216" name="xd21e23216src">115</a> of
which region he was governor. At the height of his career, in 1776, he
was arrested and imprisoned, &ldquo;as suspected of professing impious
sentiments, particularly those of Voltaire and Rousseau, with whom he
had carried on a very intimate correspondence.&rdquo; He had spoken
unwarily to inhabitants of the new towns under his jurisdiction
concerning the exterior worship of deity in Spain, the worship of
images, the fast days, the cessation of work on holy days, the
offerings at mass, and all the rest of the apparatus of popular
Catholicism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23219src" href="#xd21e23219"
name="xd21e23219src">116</a> Olavid&egrave;s prudently confessed his
error, declaring that he had &ldquo;never lost his inner faith.&rdquo;
After two years&rsquo; detention he was forced to make his penance at a
lesser <i lang="fr">auto da f&eacute;</i> in presence of sixty persons
of distinction, many of whom were suspected of holding similar
opinions, and were thus grimly warned to keep their counsel. During
four hours the reading of his process went on, and then came the
sentence. He was condemned to pass eight years in a convent; to be
banished forever from Madrid, Seville, Cordova, and the new towns of
the Sierra Morena, and to lose all his property; he was pronounced
incapable henceforth of holding any public employment or title of
honour; and he was forbidden to mount a horse, to wear any ornament of
gold, silver, pearls, diamonds, or other precious stones, or clothing
of silk or fine linen. On hearing his sentence he fainted. Afterwards,
on his knees, he received absolution. Escaping some time afterwards
from his convent, he reached France. After some years more, he
cynically produced a work entitled <i>The Gospel Triumphant, or the
Philosopher Converted</i>, which availed to procure a repeal of his
sentence; and he returned into favour.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23229src" href="#xd21e23229" name="xd21e23229src">117</a> In his
youth he &ldquo;had not the talent to play the hypocrite.&rdquo; In the
end he mastered the art as few had done.</p>
<p id="ch19.5.3" class="par">3. Another grandee, Don Christophe Ximenez
de Gongora, Duke of Almodobar, published a free and expurgated
translation of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>Raynal&rsquo;s <i>History of the Indies</i>
under another title;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23241src" href=
"#xd21e23241" name="xd21e23241src">118</a> and though he put upon the
book only an anagram of his name, he presented copies to the king. The
inquisitors, learning as much, denounced him as &ldquo;suspected of
having embraced the systems of unbelieving philosophers&rdquo;; but
this time the prosecution broke down for lack of evidence.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e23247src" href="#xd21e23247" name=
"xd21e23247src">119</a> A similar escape was made by Don Joseph
Nicholas d&rsquo;Azara, who had been minister of foreign affairs,
minister plenipotentiary of the king at Rome, and ambassador
extraordinary at Paris, and was yet denounced at Saragossa and Madrid
as an &ldquo;unbelieving philosopher.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23250src" href="#xd21e23250" name="xd21e23250src">120</a> Count
Ricla, minister of war under Charles III, was similarly charged, and
similarly escaped for lack of proofs.<a class="noteref" id=

<p id="ch19.5.4" class="par">4. In another case, a freethinking priest
skilfully anticipated prosecution. Don Philip de Samaniego,
&ldquo;priest, archdeacon of Pampeluna, chevalier of the order of St.
James, counsellor of the king and secretary-general, interpreter of
foreign languages,&rdquo; was one of those invited to assist at the
<i lang="fr">auto da f&eacute;</i> of Olavid&egrave;s. The impression
made upon him was so strong that he speedily prepared with his own hand
a confession to the effect that he had read many forbidden books, such
as those of Voltaire, Mirabeau, Rousseau, Hobbes, Spinoza, Montesquieu,
Bayle, D&rsquo;Alembert, and Diderot; and that he had been thus led
into skepticism; but that after serious reflection he had resolved to
attach himself firmly and forever to the Catholic faith, and now begged
to be absolved. The sentence was memorable. He was ordered first to
confirm his confession by oath; then to state how and from whom he had
obtained the prohibited books, where they now were, with what persons
he had talked on these matters, what persons had either refuted or
adopted his views, and which of those persons had seemed to be aware of
such doctrines in advance; such a detailed statement being the
condition of his absolution. Samaniego obeyed, and produced a long
declaration in which he incriminated nearly every enlightened man at
the court, naming Aranda, the Duke of Almodobar, Ricla, and the
minister Florida Blanca; also General Ricardos, Count of Truillas,
General Massones, Count of Montalvo, ambassador at Paris and brother of
the Duke of Sotomayor; and Counts Campomanes, Orreilly, and Lascy.
Proceedings were begun against one and all; but the undertaking was too
comprehensive, and the proofs were avowed to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>insufficient.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23268src" href="#xd21e23268" name="xd21e23268src">122</a> What
became of Samaniego, history saith not. A namesake of his, Don
Felix-Maria de Samaniego, one of the leading men of letters of the
reign of Charles IV, was arraigned before the Inquisition of Logrogno
as &ldquo;suspected of having embraced the errors of modern
philosophers and read prohibited books,&rdquo; but contrived, through
his friendship with the minister of justice, to arrange the matter
privately.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23271src" href="#xd21e23271"
name="xd21e23271src">123</a></p>
<p id="ch19.5.5" class="par">5. Out of a long series of other men of
letters persecuted by the Inquisition for giving signs of
enlightenment, a few cases are preserved by its historian, Llorente.
Don Benedict Bails, professor of mathematics at Madrid and author of a
school-book on the subject, was proceeded against in his old age,
towards the end of the reign of Charles III, as suspected of
&ldquo;atheism and materialism.&rdquo; He was ingenuous enough to
confess that he had &ldquo;had doubts on the existence of God and the
immortality of the soul,&rdquo; but that after serious reflection he
was repentant and ready to abjure all his errors. He thus escaped,
after an imprisonment. Don Louis Cagnuelo, advocate, was forced to
abjure for having written against popular superstition and against
monks in his journal <i>The Censor</i>, and was forbidden to write in
future on any subject of religion or morals. F. P. Centeno, one of the
leading critics of the reigns of Charles III and Charles IV, was an
Augustinian monk; but his profession did not save him from the
Inquisition when he made enemies by his satirical criticisms, though he
was patronized by the minister Florida Blanca. To make quite sure, he
was accused at once of atheism and Lutheranism. He had in fact preached
against ceremonialism, and as censor he had deleted from a catechism
for the free schools of Madrid an article affirming the existence of
the Limbo of children who had died unbaptized. Despite a most learned
defence, he was condemned as &ldquo;violently suspected of
heresy&rdquo; and forced to abjure, whereafter he went mad and in that
state died.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23281src" href="#xd21e23281"

<p id="ch19.5.6" class="par">6. Another <i lang="fr">savant</i> of the
same period, Don Joseph de Clavijo y Faxardo, director of the natural
history collection at Madrid, was in turn arraigned as having
&ldquo;adopted the anti-Christian principles of modern
philosophy.&rdquo; He had been the friend of Buffon and Voltaire at
Paris, had admirably translated Buffon&rsquo;s Natural History, with
notes, and was naturally something of a deist and materialist. Having
the protection of Aranda, he escaped with a secret penance and
abjuration.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23291src" href="#xd21e23291"
name="xd21e23291src">125</a> Don Thomas Iriarte, chief of the archives
in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=

indicted towards the end of the reign of Charles III, as
&ldquo;suspected of anti-Christian philosophy,&rdquo; and escaped with
similarly light punishment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23309src" href=
"#xd21e23309" name="xd21e23309src">126</a></p>
<p id="ch19.5.7" class="par">7. Still in the same reign, the Jesuit
Francisco de Ista, author of an extremely popular satire against absurd
preachers, the <i>History of the famous preacher Fray Gerondif</i>,
published under the pseudonym of Don Francisco Lobon de Salazar&mdash;a
kind of ecclesiastical <i>Don Quixote</i>&mdash;so infuriated the
preaching monks that the Holy Office received &ldquo;an almost infinite
number of denunciations of the book.&rdquo; Ista, however, was a
Jesuit, and escaped, through the influence of his order, with a
warning.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23320src" href="#xd21e23320" name=
"xd21e23320src">127</a> Influence, indeed, could achieve almost
anything in the Holy Office, whether for culprits or against the
uninculpable. In 1796, Don Raymond de Salas, a professor at Salamanca,
was actually prosecuted by the Inquisition of Madrid as being suspected
of having adopted the principles of Voltaire, Rousseau, and other
modern philosophers, he having read their works. The poor man proved
that he had done so only in order to refute them, and produced the
theses publicly maintained at Salamanca by his pupils as a result of
his teachings. The prosecution was a pure work of personal enmity on
the part of the Archbishop of Santiago (formerly bishop of Salamanca)
and others, and Salas was acquitted, with the statement that he was
entitled to reparation. Again and again did his enemies revive the
case, despite repeated acquittals, he being all the while in durance,
and at length he had to &ldquo;abjure,&rdquo; and was banished the
capital. After a time the matter was forced on the attention of the
Government, with the result that even Charles IV was asked by his
ministers to ordain that henceforth the Inquisition should not arrest
anyone without prior intimation to the king. At this stage, however,
the intriguing archbishop successfully intervened, and the ancient
machinery for the stifling of thought remained intact for the
time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23325src" href="#xd21e23325" name=

<p id="ch19.5.8" class="par">8. It is plain that the combined power of
the Church, the orders, and the Inquisition, even under Charles III,
had been substantially unimpaired, and rested on a broad foundation of
popular fanaticism and ignorance. The Inquisition attacked not merely
freethought but heresy of every kind, persecuting Jansenists and
Molinists as of old it had persecuted Lutherans, only with less power
of murder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>That much the Bourbon kings and their ministers
could accomplish, but no more. The trouble was that the enlightened
administration of Charles III in Spain did not build up a valid popular
education, the sole security for durable rationalism. Its school
policy, though not without zeal, was undemocratic, and so left the
priests in control of the mind of the multitude; and throughout the
reign the ecclesiastical revenues had been allowed to increase greatly
from private sources.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23334src" href=
"#xd21e23334" name="xd21e23334src">129</a> Like Leopold of Tuscany, he
was in advance of his people, and imposed his reforms from above. When,
accordingly, the weak and pious Charles IV succeeded in 1788, three of
the anti-clerical Ministers of his predecessor, including Aranda, were
put under arrest,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23337src" href=
"#xd21e23337" name="xd21e23337src">130</a> and clericalism resumed full

"#xd21e23342" name="xd21e23342src">131</a> Mentally and materially
alike, Spain relapsed to her former state of indigence; and the
struggle for national existence against Napoleon helped rather
traditionalist sentiment than the spirit of innovation.</p>
<p id="ch19.5.9" class="par">9. Portugal in the same period, despite
the anti-clerical policy of the famous Marquis of Pombal, made no
noticeable intellectual progress. Though that powerful statesman in
1761 abolished slavery in the kingdom,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23349src" href="#xd21e23349" name="xd21e23349src">132</a> he too

Jesuits, accordingly, did but raise up against him a new set of enemies
in the shape of the <i>Jacobeos</i>, &ldquo;the Blessed,&rdquo; a
species of Catholic Puritan, who accused him of impiety. His somewhat
forensic defence<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23363src" href=
"#xd21e23363" name="xd21e23363src">134</a> leaves the impression that
he was in reality a deist; but though he fought the fanatics by
imprisoning the Bishop of Coimbra, their leader, and by causing
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s <i>Tartufe</i> to be translated and performed,
he does not seem to have shown any favour to the deistical literature

Ministers subjecting him to persecution for some years. In 1783, the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">During the period we have been surveying, up to
the French Revolution, Switzerland, which owed much of new intellectual
life to the influx of French Protestants at the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23394src" href="#xd21e23394"
name="xd21e23394src">137</a> exhibited no less than the other European
countries the inability of the traditionary creed to stand criticism.
Calvinism by its very rigour generated a reaction within its own
special field; and the spirit of the slain Servetus triumphed strangely
over that of his slayer. Genevan Calvinism, like that of the English
Presbyterians, was transmuted first into a modified Arminianism, then
into &ldquo;Arianism&rdquo; or Socinianism, then into the Unitarianism
of modern times. In the eighteenth century Switzerland contributed to
the European movement some names, of which by far the most famous is
Rousseau; and the potent presence of Voltaire cannot have failed to
affect Swiss culture. Before his period of influence, indeed, there had
taken place not a little silent evolution of a Unitarian and deistic
kind; Socinianism, as usual, leading the way. Among the families of
Italian Protestant refugees who helped to invigorate the life of
Switzerland, as French Protestants did later that of Germany, were the
Turrettini, of whom Francesco came to Geneva in the last quarter of the
sixteenth century. One of his sons, Benedict, made a professor at
twenty-four, became a leading theologian and preacher of orthodox
Calvinism, and distinguished himself as an opponent of
Arminianism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23400src" href="#xd21e23400"
name="xd21e23400src">138</a> Still more distinguished in his day was
Benedict&rsquo;s son Fran&ccedil;ois (1623&ndash;1687), also a
professor, who repeated his father&rsquo;s services, political and
controversial, to orthodoxy, and combated Socinianism, as Benedict had
done Arminianism. But Fran&ccedil;ois&rsquo;s son Jean-Alphonse, also a
professor (whose Latin work on Christian evidences, translated into
French by a colleague, we have seen adopted and adapted by the Catholic
authorities in France), became a virtual Unitarian<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e23406src" href="#xd21e23406" name="xd21e23406src">139</a>
(1671&ndash;1737), and as such is still anathematized by Swiss
Calvinists. Against the deists, however, he was industrious, as his
grandfather, a heretic to Catholicism, had been against the Arminians,
and his father against the Socinians. The family evolution in some
degree typifies the theological process from the sixteenth to the
eighteenth century; and the apologetics of Jean-Alphonse <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>testify to the vogue of critical deism among the
educated class at Geneva in the days of Voltaire&rsquo;s nonage. He (or
his translator) deals with the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; objections to the
faith, cites approvingly Locke, Lardner, and Clarke, and combats
Woolston, but names no other English deist. The heresy, therefore,
would seem to be a domestic development from the roots noted by Viret
nearly two centuries before. One of Turrettini&rsquo;s annotators
complacently observes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23417src" href=
"#xd21e23417" name="xd21e23417src">140</a> that though deists talk of
natural religion, none of them has ever written a book in exposition of
it, the task being left to the Christians. The writer must have been
aware, on the one hand, that any deist who in those days should openly
expound natural religion as against revealed would be liable to
execution for blasphemy in any European country save England, where, as
it happened, Herbert, Hobbes, Blount, Toland, Collins, Shaftesbury, and
Tindal had all maintained the position, and on the other hand he must
have known that the <i>Ethica</i> of Spinoza was naturalistic. The
false taunt merely goes to prove that deists could maintain their
heresy on the Continent at that time without the support of books. But
soon after Turrettini&rsquo;s time they give literary indication of
their existence even in Switzerland; and in 1763 we find Voltaire
sending a package of copies of his treatise on Toleration by the hand
of &ldquo;a young M. Turretin of Geneva,&rdquo; who &ldquo;is worthy to
see the brethren, though he is the grandson of a celebrated priest of
Baal. He is reserved, but decided, as are most of the Genevese. Calvin
begins in our cantons to have no more credit than the
pope.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23427src" href="#xd21e23427"

justification. When in 1763 the Council of Geneva officially burned a

Writing to his mother on his first visit to Paris, he takes her,
ostensibly as a <i lang="fr">libre esprit</i>, into his confidence,
disparaging Marmontel and Grimm as vain. Joseph II in turn pronounced
Gustavus &ldquo;a conceited fop, an impudent braggart&rdquo; (Bain, as

and the mother of Gustavus, who forced him to break with her, does the

<p id="ch20.1" class="par first">1. Perhaps the most signal of all the
proofs of the change wrought in the opinion of the civilized world in
the eighteenth century is the fact that at the time of the War of
Independence the leading statesmen of the American colonies were
deists. Such were <span class="sc">Benjamin Franklin</span>, the
diplomatist of the Revolution; <span class="sc">Thomas Paine</span>,
its prophet and inspirer; <span class="sc">Washington</span>, its
commander; and <span class="sc">Jefferson</span>, its typical
legislator. But for these four men the American Revolution probably
could not have been accomplished in that age; and they thus represent
in a peculiar degree the power of new ideas, in fit conditions, to
transform societies, at least politically. On the other hand, the
fashion in which their relation to the creeds of their time has been
garbled, alike in American and English histories, proves how completely
they were in advance of the average thought of their day; and also how
effectively the mere institutional influence of creeds can arrest a
nation&rsquo;s mental development. It is still one of the stock
doctrines of religious sociology in England and America that deism,
miscalled atheism, wrought the Reign of Terror in the French
Revolution; when as a matter of fact the same deism was at the head of
affairs in the American.</p>
<p id="ch20.2" class="par">2. The rise of rationalism in the colonies
must be traced in the main to the imported English literature of the
eighteenth century; for the first Puritan settlements had contained at
most only a fraction of freethought; and the conditions, so deadly for
all manner even of devout heresy, made avowed unbelief impossible. The
superstitions and cruelties of the Puritan clergy, however, must have
bred a silent reaction, which prepared a soil for the deism of the next
age.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23514src" href="#xd21e23514" name=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=

<p id="ch20.3" class="par">3. Similarly prudent was <span class=

Gospel Jesus and his teachings, but rejected the notion of supernatural
revelation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23554src" href="#xd21e23554"
name="xd21e23554src">6</a> In a letter written so late as 1822 to a
Unitarian correspondent, while refusing to publish another of similar
tone, on the score that he was too old for strife, he declared that he
&ldquo;should as soon undertake to bring the crazy skulls of Bedlam to
sound understanding as to inculcate reason into that of an
Athanasian.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23560src" href=
"#xd21e23560" name="xd21e23560src">7</a> His experience of the New
England clergy is expressed in allusions to Connecticut as having been
&ldquo;the last retreat of monkish darkness, bigotry, and abhorrence of
those advances of the mind which had carried the other States a century
ahead of them&rdquo;; and in congratulations with John Adams (who had
written that &ldquo;this would be the best of all possible worlds if
there were no religion in it&rdquo;), when &ldquo;this den of the

Unitarian.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23583src" href="#xd21e23583"
name="xd21e23583src">10</a> Still more prudent was Washington, who
seems to have ranked habitually as a member of the Episcopal church;
but concerning whom Jefferson relates that, when the clergy, having
noted his constant abstention from any public mention of the Christian
religion, so penned an address to him on his withdrawal from the
Presidency as almost to force him to some declaration, he answered
every part of the address but that, which he entirely ignored. It is
further noted that only in his valedictory letter to the governors of
the States, on resigning his commission, did he speak of the
&ldquo;benign influence of the Christian religion&rdquo;<a class=

avoided the Communion in church.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23597src"
href="#xd21e23597" name="xd21e23597src">12</a> For the rest, the broad
fact that all mention of deity was excluded from the Constitution of
the United States must be historically taken to signify a profound
change in the convictions of the leading minds among the people as
compared with the beliefs of their ancestors. At the same time, the
fact that they as a rule dissembled their unbelief is a proof that,
even where legal penalties do not attach to an avowal of serious
heresy, there inheres in the menace of mere social ostracism a power
sufficient to coerce the outward life of public and professional men of
all grades, in a democratic community where faith maintains and is
maintained by a competitive multitude of priests. With this force the
freethought of our own age has to reckon, after Inquisitions and
blasphemy laws have become obsolete.</p>
<p id="ch20.4" class="par">4. Nothing in American culture-history more
clearly proves the last proposition than the case of <span class=
"sc">Thomas Paine</span>, the virtual founder of modern democratic
freethought in Great Britain and the States.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23611src" href="#xd21e23611" name="xd21e23611src">13</a> It does
not appear that Paine openly professed any heresy while he lived in
England, or in America before the French Revolution. Yet the first
sentence of his <i>Age of Reason</i>, of which the first part was
written shortly before his imprisonment, under sentence of death from
the Robespierre Government, in Paris (1793), shows that he had long
held pronounced deistic opinions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23623src"
href="#xd21e23623" name="xd21e23623src">14</a> They were probably
matured in the States, where, as we have seen, such views were often
privately held, though there, as Franklin is said to have jesuitically
declared in his old age, by way of encouraging immigration:
&ldquo;Atheism is unknown; infidelity rare and secret, so that persons
may live to a great age in this country without having their piety
shocked by meeting with either an atheist or an infidel.&rdquo; Paine
did an unequalled service to the American Revolution by his <i>Common
Sense</i> and his series of pamphlets headed <i>The Crisis</i>: there
is, in fact, little question that but for the intense stimulus thus
given by him at critical moments the movement might have collapsed at
an early stage. Yet he seems to have had no thought there and then of
avowing his deism. It was in part for the express purpose of resisting
the ever-strengthening attack of atheism in France on deism
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>itself that he undertook to save it by
repudiating the Jud&aelig;o-Christian revelation; and it is not even
certain that he would have issued the <i>Age of Reason</i> when it did
appear, had he not supposed he was going to his death when put under
arrest, on which score he left the manuscript for publication.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e23641src" href="#xd21e23641" name=
"xd21e23641src">15</a></p>
<p id="ch20.5" class="par">5. Its immediate effect was much greater in
Britain, where his <i>Rights of Man</i> had already won him a vast
popularity in the teeth of the most furious reaction, than in America.
There, to his profound chagrin, he found that his honest utterance of
his heresy brought on him hatred, calumny, ostracism, and even personal
and political molestation. In 1797 he had founded in Paris the little
&ldquo;Church of Theo-philanthropy,&rdquo; beginning his inaugural
discourse with the words: &ldquo;Religion has two principal enemies,
Fanaticism and Infidelity, or that which is called atheism. The first
requires to be combated by reason and morality; the other by natural
philosophy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23658src" href=
"#xd21e23658" name="xd21e23658src">16</a> These were his settled
convictions; and he lived to find himself shunned and vilified, in the
name of religion, in the country whose freedom he had so puissantly
wrought to win.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23664src" href="#xd21e23664"
name="xd21e23664src">17</a> The Quakers, his father&rsquo;s sect,
refused him a burial-place. He has had sympathy and fair play, as a
rule, only from the atheists whom he distrusted and opposed, or from
thinkers who no longer hold by deism. There is reason to think that in
his last years the deistic optimism which survived the deep
disappointments of the French Revolution began to give way before
deeper reflection on the cosmic problem,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23676src" href="#xd21e23676" name="xd21e23676src">18</a> if not
before the treatment he had undergone at the hands of Unitarians and
Trinitarians alike. The Butlerian argument, that Nature is as
unsatisfactory as revelation, had been pressed upon him by Bishop
Watson in a reply to the <i>Age of Reason</i>; and though, like most
deists of his age, he regarded it as a vain defence of orthodoxy, he
was not the man to remain long blind to its force against deistic
assumptions. Like Franklin, he had energetically absorbed and given
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>out the new ideals of physical science; his
originality in the invention of a tubular iron bridge, and in the
application of steam to navigation,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23685src" href="#xd21e23685" name="xd21e23685src">19</a> being
nearly as notable as that of Franklin&rsquo;s great discovery
concerning electricity. Had the two men drawn their philosophy from the
France of the latter part of the century instead of the England of the
first, they had doubtless gone deeper. As it was, temperamental
optimism had kept both satisfied with the transitional formula; and in
the France of before and after the Revolution they lived pre-occupied
with politics.</p>
<p id="ch20.6" class="par">6. The habit of reticence or dissimulation
among American public men was only too surely confirmed by the
treatment meted out to Paine. Few stood by him; and the vigorous
deistic movement set up in his latter years by Elihu Palmer soon
succumbed to the conditions,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23699src" href=
"#xd21e23699" name="xd21e23699src">20</a> though Palmer&rsquo;s book,
<i>The Principles of Nature</i> (1802, rep. by Richard Carlile, 1819),
is a powerful attack on the Judaic and Christian systems all along the
line. George Houston, leaving England after two years&rsquo;
imprisonment for his translation of d&rsquo;Holbach&rsquo;s <i lang=
"la">Ecce Homo</i>, went to New York, where he edited the
<i>Minerva</i> (1822), reprinted his book, and started a freethought
journal, <i>The Correspondence</i>. That, however, lasted only eighteen
months. All the while, such statesmen as Madison and Monroe, the latter
Paine&rsquo;s personal friend, seem to have been of his way of
thinking,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23715src" href="#xd21e23715" name=
"xd21e23715src">21</a> though the evidence is scanty. Thus it came
about that, save for the liberal movement of the Hicksite
Quakers,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23718src" href="#xd21e23718" name=
"xd21e23718src">22</a> the American deism of Paine&rsquo;s day was
decorously transformed into the later Unitarianism, the extremely rapid
advance of which in the next generation is the best proof of the
commonness of private unbelief. The influence of Priestley, who,
persecuted at home, went to end his days in the States, had doubtless
much to do with the Unitarian development there, as in England; but it
seems certain that the whole deistic movement, including the work of
Paine and Palmer, had tended to move out of orthodoxy many of those who
now, recoiling from the fierce hostility directed against the outspoken
freethinkers, sought a more rational form of creed than that of the
orthodox churches. The deistic tradition in a manner centred in the
name of Jefferson, and the known deism of that leader would do much to
make fashionable a heresy which combined his views with a decorous
attitude to the Sacred Books. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">All over the civilized world, as we have seen, the
terrors of the French Revolution evoked an intellectual no less than a
political reaction, its stress being most apparent and most destructive
in those countries in which there had been previously the largest
measure of liberty. Nowhere was it more intense or more disastrous than
in England. In countries such as Denmark and Spain, only lately and
superficially liberalized, there was no great progress to undo: in
England, though liberty was never left without an indomitable witness,
there was a violent reversal of general movement, not to be wholly
rectified in half a century. Joined in a new activity with the civil
power for the suppression of all innovating thought, the Church rapidly
attained to an influence it had not possessed since the days of
Sacheverel and a degree of wealth it had not before reached since the
Reformation. The wealth of the upper class was at its disposal to an
unheard-of extent, there being apparently no better way of fighting the
new danger of democracy; and dissent joined hands with the
establishment to promote orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="par">The average tone in England in the first quarter of the
century may be gathered from the language held by a man so enlightened,
comparatively speaking, as Sydney Smith, wit, humourist, Whig, and
clergyman. In 1801 we find him, in a preface never reprinted,
prescribing various measures of religious strategy in addition
&ldquo;to the just, necessary, and innumerable invectives which have
been levelled against Rousseau, Voltaire, D&rsquo;Alembert, and the
whole pandemonium of those martyrs to atheism, who toiled with such
laborious malice, and suffered odium with such inflexible profligacy,
for the wretchedness and despair of their fellow
creatures.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23737src" href=
"#xd21e23737" name="xd21e23737src">1</a> That this was not jesting may
be gathered from his daughter&rsquo;s account of his indignation when a
publisher sent him &ldquo;a work of irreligious tendency,&rdquo; and
when Jeffrey admitted &ldquo;irreligious <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb387" href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>opinions&rdquo; to
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. To the former he writes that every
principle of suspicion and fear would be excited in me by a man who
professed himself an infidel&rdquo;; and to Jeffrey: &ldquo;Do you mean
to take care that the Review shall not profess infidel principles?
Unless this is the case I must absolutely give up all connection with
it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23747src" href="#xd21e23747"
name="xd21e23747src">2</a> All the while any semblance of
&ldquo;infidelity&rdquo; in any article in the Review must have been of
the most cautious kind.</p>
<p class="par">In the Catholic countries, naturally, the reaction was
no less violent. In Italy, as we saw, it began in Tuscany almost at
once. The rule of Napoleon, it is true, secured complete freedom of the
Press as regarded translation of freethinking books, an entire liberty
of conscience in religious matters, and a sharp repression of
clericalism, the latter policy going to the length of expelling all the
religious orders and confiscating their property.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23754src" href="#xd21e23754" name="xd21e23754src">3</a> All this
counted for change; but the Napoleonic rule all the while choked one of
the springs of vital thought&mdash;to wit, the spirit of political
liberty; and in 1814&ndash;15 the clerical system returned in full
force, as it did all over Italy. Everywhere freethought was banned. All
criticism of Catholicism was a penal offence; and in the kingdom of
Naples alone, in 1825, there were 27,612 priests, 8,455 monks, 8,185
nuns, 20 archbishops, and 73 bishops, though in 1807 the French
influence had caused the dissolution of some 250 convents.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e23760src" href="#xd21e23760" name=
"xd21e23760src">4</a> At Florence the Censure forbade, in 1817, the
issue of a new edition of the translated work of Cabanis on <i lang=
"fr">Les Rapports du physique et du moral</i>; and Mascagni, the
physiologist, was invited to delete from his work a definition of man
in which no notice was taken of the soul.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23769src" href="#xd21e23769" name="xd21e23769src">5</a> It was
even proclaimed that the works of Voltaire and Rousseau were not to be
read in the public libraries without ecclesiastical permission; but
this veto was not seriously treated.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23772src" href="#xd21e23772" name="xd21e23772src">6</a> All
native energy, however, was either cowed or cajoled into passivity. If,
accordingly, the mind of Italy was to survive, it must be by the
assimilation of the culture of freer States; and this culture,
reinforced by the writings of Leopardi, generated a new intellectual
life, which was a main factor in the ultimate achievement of Italian
liberation from Austrian rule.</p>
<p class="par">Spain, under Charles IV, became so thoroughly
re-clericalized at the very outbreak of the Revolution that no more
leeway seemed possible; but even in Spain, early in the nineteenth
century, the government found means to retrogress yet further, and the
minister Caballero sent an order to the universities forbidding the
study of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>moral philosophy. The king, he justly declared,
did not want philosophers, but good and obedient subjects.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e23781src" href="#xd21e23781" name=
"xd21e23781src">7</a></p>
<p class="par">In France, where the downfall of Napoleon meant the
restoration of the monarchy, the intellectual reaction was really less
powerful than in England. The new spirit had been too widely and
continuously at work, from Voltaire onwards, to be politically
expelled; and the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 gave the proof that even
on the political side the old spirit was incapable of permanent
recovery. In Germany, where freethinking was associated not with the
beaten cause of the Revolution but in large measure with the national
movement for liberation from the tyranny of Napoleon,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e23789src" href="#xd21e23789" name="xd21e23789src">8</a> the
religious reaction was substantially emotional and unintellectual,
though it had intellectual representatives, notably Schleiermacher.
Apart from his culture-movement, the revival consisted mainly in a new
Pietism, partly orthodox, partly mystical;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23798src" href="#xd21e23798" name="xd21e23798src">9</a> and on
those lines it ran later to the grossest excesses. But among the
educated classes of Germany there was the minimum of arrest, because
there the intellectual life was least directly associated with the
political, and the ecclesiastical life relatively the least organized.
The very separateness of the German States, then and later so often
deplored by German patriots, was really a condition of relative
security for freedom of thought and research; and the resulting
multiplicity of universities meant a variety of intellectual effort not
then paralleled in any other country.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23806src" href="#xd21e23806" name="xd21e23806src">10</a> What may
be ranked as the most important effect of the reaction in
Germany&mdash;the turning of Kant, Fichte, and Hegel in succession to
the task of reconciling rational philosophy with religion in the
interests of social order&mdash;was in itself a rationalistic process
as compared with the attitude of orthodoxy in other lands. German
scholarship, led by the re-organized university of Berlin, was in fact
one of the most progressive intellectual forces in Europe during the
first half of the nineteenth century; and only its comparative
isolation, its confinement to a cultured class, prevented it from
affecting popular thought as widely as deism had done in the preceding
century. Even in the countries in which popular and university culture
were less sharply divided, the German influence was held at bay like
others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But in time the spirit of progress regained strength,
the most decisive form of recovery being the new development of the
struggle for political liberty from about 1830 onwards. In England the
advance thenceforward was to be broadly continuous on the political
side. On the Continent it culminated for the time in the explosions of
1848, which were followed in the Germanic world by another political
reaction, in which freethought suffered; and in France, after a few
years, by the Second Empire, in which clericalism was again fostered.
But these checks have proved impermanent.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As with the cause of democracy, so with the cause
of rationalism, the forward movement grew only the deeper and more
powerful through the check; and the nineteenth century closed on a
record of freethinking progress which may be said to outbulk that of
all the previous centuries of the modern era together. So great was the
activity of the century in point of mere quantity that it is
impossible, within the scheme of a &ldquo;Short History,&rdquo; to
treat it on even such a reduced scale of narrative as has been applied
to the past. A detailed history on national lines from the French
Revolution onwards would mean another book as large as the present. On
however large a scale it might be written, further, it would involve a
recognition of international influences such as had never before been
evolved, save when on a much smaller scale the educated world all round
read and wrote Latin. Since Goethe, the international aspect of culture
upon which he laid stress has become ever more apparent; and scientific
and philosophical thought, in particular, are world-wide in their scope
and bearing. It must here suffice, therefore, to take a series of broad
and general views of the past century&rsquo;s work, leaving adequate
critical and narrative treatment for separate undertakings.<a class=

conspectus (1) of the main movements and forces that during the century

of the main advances made and the point reached in the culture of the
nations, separately considered. At the same time, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>the
forces of rationalism may be discriminated into Particular and General.
We may then roughly represent the lines of movement, in
non-chronological order, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">I.&mdash;<i>Forces of criticism and corrective
thought bearing expressly on religious beliefs.</i></p>
<p class="par">1. In Great Britain and America, the new movements of
popular freethought begun by Paine, and lasting continuously to the
present day.</p>
<p class="par">2. In France and elsewhere, the reverberation of the
attack of Voltaire, d&rsquo;Holbach, Dupuis, and Volney, carried on
most persistently in Catholic countries by the Freemasons, as against
official orthodoxy after 1815.</p>
<p class="par">3. German &ldquo;rationalism,&rdquo; proceeding from
English deism, moving towards naturalist as against supernaturalist
conceptions, dissolving the notion of the miraculous in both Old and
New Testament history, analysing the literary structure of the sacred
books, and all along affecting studious thought in other countries.</p>
<p class="par">4. The literary compromise of Lessing, claiming for all
religions a place in a scheme of &ldquo;divine education.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">5. In England, the neo-Christianity of the school of
Coleridge, a disintegrating force, promoting the &ldquo;Broad
Church&rdquo; tendency, which in Dean Milman was so pronounced as to
bring on him charges of rationalism.</p>
<p class="par">6. The utilitarianism of the school of Bentham, carried
into moral and social science.</p>
<p class="par">7. Comtism, making little direct impression on the
&ldquo;constructive&rdquo; lines laid by the founder, but affecting
critical thought in many directions.</p>
<p class="par">8. German philosophy, Kantian and post-Kantian, in
particular the Hegelian, turned to anti-Christian and
anti-supernaturalist account by Strauss, Vatke, Bruno Bauer, Feuerbach,
and Marx.</p>
<p class="par">9. German atheism and scientific
&ldquo;materialism&rdquo;&mdash;represented by Feuerbach and
B&uuml;chner (who, however, rejected the term &ldquo;materialism&rdquo;
as inappropriate).</p>
<p class="par">10. Revived English deism, involving destructive
criticism of Christianity, as in Hennell, F. W. Newman, R. W. Mackay,
W. R. Greg, Theodore Parker, and Thomas Scott, partly in co-operation
with Unitarianism.</p>
<p class="par">11. American transcendentalism or pantheism&mdash;the
school of Emerson.</p>
<p class="par">12. Colenso&rsquo;s preliminary attack on the narrative
of the Pentateuch, a systematized return to Voltairean common-sense,
rectifying the unscientific course of the earlier &ldquo;higher
criticism&rdquo; on the historical issue.</p>
<p class="par">13. The later or scientific &ldquo;higher
criticism&rdquo; of the Old Testament&mdash;represented by Kuenen,
Wellhausen, and their successors.</p>
<p class="par">14. New historical criticism of Christian origins, in
particular the work of Strauss and Baur in Germany, Renan and Havet in
France, and their successors.</p>
<p class="par">15. Exhibition of rationalism within the churches, as in
Germany, Holland, and Switzerland generally; in England in the
<i>Essays and Reviews</i>; later in multitudes of essays and books, and
in the ethical criticism of the Old Testament; in America in popular
theology.</p>
<p class="par">16. Association of rationalistic doctrine with the
Socialist movements, new and old, from Owen to Bebel.</p>
<p class="par">17. Communication of doubt and moral questioning through
poetry and <i lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>&mdash;as in Shelley, Byron,
Coleridge, Clough, Tennyson, Carlyle, Arnold, Browning, Swinburne,
Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Victor Hugo, Leconte de Lisle, Leopardi, and
certain French and English novelists.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">II.&mdash;<i>Modern Science, physical, mental, and
moral, sapping the bases of all supernaturalist systems.</i></p>
<p class="par">1. Astronomy, newly directed by Laplace.</p>
<p class="par">2. Geology, gradually connected (as in Britain by
Chambers) with</p>
<p class="par">3. Biology, made definitely non-deistic by Darwin.</p>
<p class="par">4. The comprehension of all science in the Evolution
Theory, as by Spencer, advancing on Comte.</p>
<p class="par">5. Psychology, as regards localization of brain
functions.</p>
<p class="par">6. Comparative mythology, as yet imperfectly applied to
Christism.</p>
<p class="par">7. Sociology, as outlined by Comte, Buckle, Spencer,
Winwood Reade, Lester Ward, Giddings, Tarde, Durkheim, and others, on
strictly naturalistic lines.</p>
<p class="par">8. Comparative Hierology; the methodical application of
principles insisted on by all the deists, and formulated in the
interests of deism by Lessing, but latterly freed of his
implications.</p>
<p class="par">9. Above all, the later development of Anthropology (in
the wide English sense of the term), which, beginning to take shape in
the eighteenth century, came to new life in the latter part of the
nineteenth; and is now one of the most widely cultivated of all the
sciences&mdash;especially on the side of religious creed and
psychology.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, we may group somewhat as follows the
general forces of retardation of freethought operating throughout the
century:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">1. Penal laws, still operative in Britain and
Germany against popular freethought propaganda, and till recently in
Britain against any endowment of freethought.</p>
<p class="par">2. Class interests, involving in the first half of the
century a social conspiracy against rationalism in England.</p>
<p class="par">3. Commercial pressure thus set up, and always involved
in the influence of churches.</p>
<p class="par">4. In England, identification of orthodox Dissent with
political Liberalism&mdash;a sedative.</p>
<p class="par">5. Concessions by the clergy, especially in England and
the United States&mdash;to many, another sedative.</p>
<p class="par">6. Above all, the production of new masses of popular
ignorance in the industrial nations, and continued lack of education in
the others.</p>
<p class="par">7. On this basis, business-like and in large part
secular-minded organization of the endowed churches, as against a
freethought propaganda hampered by the previously named causes, and in
England by laws which veto all direct endowment of anti-Christian
heresy.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It remains to make, with forced brevity, the surveys
thus outlined.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch21.1" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd21e1676">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Section 1.&mdash;Popular Propaganda
and Culture</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch21.1.1" class="par first">1. If any one circumstance more than
another differentiates the life of to-day from that of older
civilizations, or from that of previous centuries of the modern era, it
is the diffusion of rationalistic views among the &ldquo;common
people.&rdquo; In no other era is to be found the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>phenomenon of widespread critical skepticism
among the labouring masses: in all previous ages, though chronic
complaint is made of <i>some</i> unbelief among the uneducated, the
constant and abject ignorance of the mass of the people has been the
sure foothold of superstitious systems. Within the last century the
area of the recognizably civilized world has grown far vaster; and in
the immense populations that have thus arisen there is a relative
degree of enlightenment, coupled with a degree of political power never
before attained. Merely to survey, then, the broad movement of popular
culture in the period in question will yield a useful notion of the
dynamic change in the balance of thought in modern times, and will make
more intelligible the special aspects of the culture process.</p>
<p class="par">This vital change in the distribution of knowledge is
largely to be attributed to the written and spoken teaching of a line
of men who made popular enlightenment their great aim. Their leading
type among the English-speaking races is <span class="sc">Thomas
Paine</span>, whom we have seen combining a gospel of democracy with a
gospel of critical reason in the midst of the French Revolution. Never
before had rationalism been made widely popular. The English and French
deists had written for the middle and upper classes. Peter Annet was
practically the first who sought to reach the multitude; and his
punishment expressed the special resentment aroused in the governing
classes by such a policy. Of all the English freethinkers of the
earlier deistical period he alone was selected for reprinting by the
propagandists of the Paine period. Paine was to Annet, however, as a
cannon to a musket, and through the democratic ferment of his day he
won an audience a hundredfold wider than Annet could have dreamt of
reaching. The anger of the governing classes, in a time of
anti-democratic panic, was proportional. Paine would have been at least
imprisoned for his <i>Rights of Man</i> had he not fled from England in
time; and the sale of all his books was furiously prohibited and
ferociously punished. Yet they circulated everywhere, even in
Protestant Ireland,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23942src" href=
"#xd21e23942" name="xd21e23942src">12</a> hitherto affected only under
the surface of upper-class life by deism. The circulation of Bishop
Watson&rsquo;s <i>Apology</i> in reply only served to spread the
contagion, as it brought the issues before multitudes who would not
otherwise have heard of them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23951src"
href="#xd21e23951" name="xd21e23951src">13</a> All the while, direct
propaganda was carried on by translations and reprints as well as by
fresh English tractates. Diderot&rsquo;s <i>Thoughts on Religion</i>,
and Fr&eacute;ret&rsquo;s <i>Letter from Thrasybulus to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393</a>]</span>Leucippus</i>, seem to have been great
favourites among the Painites, as was Elihu Palmer&rsquo;s
<i>Principles of Nature</i>; and Volney&rsquo;s <i>Ruins of Empires</i>
had a large vogue. Condorcet&rsquo;s <i>Esquisse</i> had been promptly
translated in 1795; the translation of d&rsquo;Holbach&rsquo;s
<i>System of Nature</i> reached a third edition in 1817;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e23979src" href="#xd21e23979" name=
"xd21e23979src">14</a> that of Raynal&rsquo;s History had been
reprinted in 1804; and that of Helv&eacute;tius <i>On the Mind</i> in
1810; while an English abridgment of Bayle in four volumes, on
freethinking lines, appeared in 1826.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.2" class="par">2. Meantime, new writers arose to carry
into fuller detail the attacks of Paine, sharpening their weapons on
those of the more scholarly French deists. A <i>Life of Jesus,
including his Apocryphal History</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23990src" href="#xd21e23990" name="xd21e23990src">15</a> was
published in 1818, with such astute avoidance of all comment that it
escaped prosecution. Others, taking a more daring course, fared
accordingly. George Houston translated the <i lang="la">Ecce Homo</i>
of d&rsquo;Holbach, first publishing it at Edinburgh in 1799, and
reprinting it in London in 1813. For the second issue he was
prosecuted, fined &pound;200, and imprisoned for two years in Newgate.
Robert Wedderburn, a mulatto calling himself &ldquo;the Rev.,&rdquo; in
reality a superannuated journeyman tailor who officiated in Hopkins
Street Unitarian Chapel, London, was in 1820 sentenced to two
years&rsquo; imprisonment in Dorchester Jail for a &ldquo;blasphemous
libel&rdquo; contained in one of his pulpit discourses. His Letters to
the Rev. Solomon Herschell (the Jewish Chief Rabbi) and to the
Archbishop of Canterbury show a happy vein of orderly irony and not a
little learning, despite his profession of apostolic ignorance; and at
the trial the judge admitted his defence to be &ldquo;exceedingly well
drawn up.&rdquo; His publications naturally received a new impetus, and
passed to a more drastic order of mockery.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.3" class="par">3. As the years went on, the persecution
in England grew still fiercer; but it was met with a stubborn hardihood
which wore out even the bitter malice of piety. One of the worst
features of the religious crusade was that it affected to attack not
unbelief but &ldquo;vice,&rdquo; such being the plea on which
Wilberforce and others prosecuted, during a period of more than twenty
years, the publishers and booksellers who issued the works of
Paine.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23998src" href="#xd21e23998" name=
"xd21e23998src">16</a> But even that dissembling device did not
ultimately avail. A name not to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394"
href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>forgotten by those who value
obscure service to human freedom is that of <span class="sc">Richard
Carlile</span>, who between 1819 and 1835 underwent nine years&rsquo;
imprisonment in his unyielding struggle for the freedom of the Press,
of thought, and of speech.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24009src" href=
"#xd21e24009" name="xd21e24009src">17</a> John Clarke, an ex-Methodist,
became one of Carlile&rsquo;s shopmen, was tried in 1824 for selling
one of his publications, and &ldquo;after a spirited defence, in which
he read many of the worst passages of the Bible,&rdquo; was sentenced
to three years&rsquo; imprisonment, and to find securities for good
behaviour during life. The latter disability he effectively anticipated
by writing, while in prison, <i>A Critical Review of the Life,
Character, and Miracles of Jesus</i>, wherein Christian feelings were
treated as Christians had treated the feelings of freethinkers, with a
much more destructive result. Published first, strangely enough, in the
<i>Newgate Magazine</i>, it was republished in 1825 and 1839, with
impunity. Thus did a brutal bigotry bring upon itself ever a deadlier
retaliation, till it sickened of the contest. Those who threw up the
struggle on the orthodox side declaimed as before about the tone of the
unbeliever&rsquo;s attack, failing to read the plain lesson that, while
noisy fanaticism, doing its own worst and vilest, deterred from
utterance all the gentler and more sympathetic spirits on the side of
reason, the work of reason could be done only by the harder natures,
which gave back blow for blow and insult for insult, rejoicing in the
encounter. Thus championed, freethought could not be crushed. The
propagandist and publishing work done by Carlile was carried on
diversely by such free lances as <span class="sc">Robert Taylor</span>
(ex-clergyman, author of the <i>Diegesis</i>, 1829, and <i>The
Devil&rsquo;s Pulpit</i>, 1830), <span class="sc">Charles
Southwell</span> (1814&ndash;1860), and William Hone,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e24046src" href="#xd21e24046" name="xd21e24046src">18</a> who
ultimately became an independent preacher. Southwell, a disciple of
Robert Owen, who edited <i>The Oracle of Reason</i>, was imprisoned for
a year in 1840 for publishing in that journal an article entitled
&ldquo;The Jew Book&rdquo;; and was succeeded in the editorship by
<span class="sc">George Jacob Holyoake</span> (1817&ndash;1906),
another Owenite missionary, who met a similar sentence; whereafter
George Adams and his wife, who continued to publish the journal, were
imprisoned in turn. Matilda Roalfe and Mrs. Emma Martin about
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>the same period underwent imprisonment for like
causes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24064src" href="#xd21e24064" name=
"xd21e24064src">19</a> In this fashion, by the steady courage of a
much-enduring band of men and women, was set on foot a systematic
Secularist propaganda&mdash;the name having relation to the term
&ldquo;Secularism,&rdquo; coined by Holyoake.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.4" class="par">4. In this evolution political activities
played an important part. Henry Hetherington (1792&ndash;1849), the
strenuous democrat who in 1830 began the trade union movement, and so
became the founder of Chartism, fought for the right of publication in
matters of freethought as in politics. After undergoing two
imprisonments of six months each (1832), and carrying on for three and
a half years the struggle for an untaxed Press, which ended in his
victory (1834), he was in 1840 indicted for publishing
<i>Haslam&rsquo;s Letters to the Clergy of all Denominations</i>, a
freethinking criticism of Old Testament morality. He defended himself
so ably that Lord Denman, the judge, confessed to have &ldquo;listened
with feelings of great interest and sentiments of respect too&rdquo;;
and Justice Talfourd later spoke of the defence as marked by
&ldquo;great propriety and talent.&rdquo; Nevertheless, he was punished
by four months&rsquo; imprisonment.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e24075src" href="#xd21e24075" name="xd21e24075src">20</a> In the
following year, on the advice of Francis Place, he brought a test
prosecution for blasphemy against Moxon, the poet-publisher, for
issuing Shelley&rsquo;s complete works, including <i>Queen Mab</i>.
Talfourd, then Serjeant, defended Moxon, and pleaded that there
&ldquo;must be some alteration of the law, or some restriction of the
right to put it in action&rdquo;; but the jury were impartial enough to
find the publisher guilty, though he received no punishment.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e24087src" href="#xd21e24087" name=
"xd21e24087src">21</a> Among other works published by Hetherington was
one entitled <i>A Hunt after the Devil</i>, &ldquo;by Dr. P. Y.&rdquo;
(really by Lieutenant Lecount), in which the story of Noah&rsquo;s ark
was subjected to a destructive criticism.<a class="noteref" id=

<p id="ch21.1.5" class="par">5. Holyoake had been a missionary and
martyr in the movement of Socialism set up by <span class="sc">Robert
Owen</span>, whose teaching, essentially scientific on its
psychological or philosophical side, was the first effort to give
systematic effect to democratic ideals by organizing industry. It was
in the discussions of the &ldquo;Association of all Classes of all
Nations,&rdquo; formed by Owen in 1835, that the word
&ldquo;Socialism&rdquo; first became current.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e24107src" href="#xd21e24107" name="xd21e24107src">23</a> Owen was
a freethinker in all things;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24113src" href=
"#xd21e24113" name="xd21e24113src">24</a> and his whole movement was so
penetrated by an anti-theological spirit that the clergy as a rule
became its bitter enemies, though such publicists as Macaulay and John
Mill also combined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396"

economic grounds.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24118src" href=
"#xd21e24118" name="xd21e24118src">25</a> Up till the middle of 1817 he
had on his side a large body of &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; and
highly-placed philanthropists, his notable success in his own social
and commercial undertakings being his main recommendation. His early
<i>Essays on the Formation of Character</i>, indeed, were sufficient to
reveal his heterodoxy; but not until, at his memorable public meeting
on August 21, 1817, he began to expatiate on &ldquo;the gross errors
that have been combined with the fundamental notions of every religion
that has hitherto been taught to men&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e24134src" href="#xd21e24134" name="xd21e24134src">26</a> did he
rank as an aggressive freethinker. It was in his own view the
turning-point of his life. He was not prosecuted; though Brougham
declared that if any politician had said half as much he would have
been &ldquo;burned alive&rdquo;; but the alienation of
&ldquo;moderate&rdquo; opinion at once began; and Owen, always more
fervid than prudent, never recovered his influence among the upper
classes. Nonetheless, &ldquo;his secularistic teaching gained such
influence among the working classes as to give occasion for the
statement in the <i>Westminster Review</i> (1839) that his principles
were the actual creed of a great portion of them.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e24140src" href="#xd21e24140" name=
"xd21e24140src">27</a></p>
<p class="par">Owen&rsquo;s polemic method&mdash;if it could properly
be so called&mdash;was not so much a criticism of dogma as a calm
impeachment of religion in a spirit of philanthropy. No reformer was
ever more entirely free from the spirit of wrath: on this side Owen
towers above comparison. &ldquo;There is no place found in him for
scorn or indignation. He cannot bring himself to speak or think evil of
any man. He carried out in his daily life his own teaching that man is
not the proper object of praise or blame. Throughout his numerous works
there is hardly a sentence of indignation&mdash;of personal
denunciation never. He loves the sinner, and can hardly bring himself
to hate the sin.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24145src" href=
"#xd21e24145" name="xd21e24145src">28</a> He had come by his
rationalism through the influence rather of Rousseau than of Voltaire;
and he had assimilated the philosophic doctrine of determinism&mdash;of
all ideals the most difficult to realize in conduct&mdash;with a
thoroughness of which the flawed Rousseau was incapable. There was thus
presented to the world the curious case of a man who on the side of
character carried rationalism to the perfection of ideal
&ldquo;saintliness,&rdquo; while in the general application of rational
thought to concrete problems he was virtually unteachable. For an
absolute and immovable conviction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397"

And most Christians accordingly shunned and feared or hated him.</p>
<p class="par">Such a personality was evidently a formidable force as
against the reinforced English orthodoxy of the first generation of the
nineteenth century. The nature of Owen&rsquo;s propaganda as against
religion may be best sampled from his lecture, &ldquo;<i>The New
Religion</i>: or, Religion founded on the Immutable Laws of the
Universe, contrasted with all Religions founded on Human
Testimony,&rdquo; delivered at the London Tavern on October 20,
1830:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24158src" href="#xd21e24158" name=

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Under the arrangements which have hitherto
existed for educating and governing man, four general characters have
been produced among the human race. These four characters appear to be

<p class="par">&ldquo;No. 1. May be termed the conscientious religious

<p class="par">No. 2. Unbelievers in the truth of any religion, but who

<p class="par">No. 3. Unbelievers who openly avow their disbelief in
the truth of any religion, such as Deists, Atheists, Skeptics, etc.,
etc., but who do not perceive the laws of nature relative to man as an
individual, or when united in a social state.</p>
<p class="par">No. 4. Disbelievers in all past and present religions,

developed by facts derived from all past experience; and who, by a
careful study of these facts, deduce from them the religion of
nature.</p>
<p class="par">Class No. 1 is formed, under certain circumstances, from

men of strong moral and moderate intellectual faculty.... Class No. 4

and moral faculty....&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Thus all forms of opinion were shown to proceed either
from intellectual or moral defect, save the opinions of Owen. Such
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398</a>]</span>propositions, tranquilly elaborated, were
probably as effective in producing irritation as any frontal attack
upon any dogmas, narratives, or polities. But, though not even
consistent (inasmuch as the fundamental thesis that &ldquo;character is
formed by circumstances&rdquo; is undermined by the datum of four
varieties of organization), they were potent to influence serious men
otherwise broadly instructed as to the nature of religious history and
the irrationality of dogma; and Owen for a generation, despite the
inevitable failure and frustration of his social schemes, exercised by
his movement a very wide influence on popular life. To a considerable
extent it was furthered by the popular deistic philosophy of
<span class="sc">George</span> and <span class="sc">Andrew
Combe</span>&mdash;a kind of deistic positivism&mdash;which then had a
great vogue;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24185src" href="#xd21e24185"
name="xd21e24185src">31</a> and by the implications of phrenology, then
also in its most scientific and progressive stage. When, for various
reasons, Owen&rsquo;s movement dissolved, the freethinking element
seems to have been absorbed in the secular party, while the others
appear to have gone in large part to build up the movement of
Co-operation. On the whole, the movement of popular freethought in
England could be described as poor, struggling, and persecuted, only
the most hardy and zealous venturing to associate themselves with it.
The imprisonment of Holyoake (1842) for six months, on a trifling
charge of blasphemy, is an illustration of the brutal spirit of public
orthodoxy at the time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24191src" href=
"#xd21e24191" name="xd21e24191src">32</a> Where bigotry could thus only
injure and oppress without suppressing heresy, it stimulated
resistance; and the result of the stimulus was a revival of popular
propaganda which led to the founding of a Secular Society in 1852.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.6" class="par">6. This date broadly coincides with the
maximum domination of conventional orthodoxy in English life. From
about the middle of the century the balance gradually changes. In 1852
we find the publisher Henry Bohn reissuing the worthless apologetic
works of the Rev. Andrew Fuller, with a &ldquo;publisher&rsquo;s
preface&rdquo; in which they are said to &ldquo;maintain an
acknowledged pre-eminence,&rdquo; though written &ldquo;at a period of
our national history when the writings of Volney and Gibbon, and
especially of Thomas Paine, fostered by the political effects of the
French Revolution, had deteriorated the morals of the people, and
infused the poison of infidelity into the disaffected portion of the
public.&rdquo; We have here still the note of early-nineteenth-century
Anglican respectability, not easily to be matched in human history for
hollowness and blatancy. Fuller is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399"
href="#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span>at once one of the most rabid
and one of the most futile of the thousand and one defenders of the
faith. A sample of his mind and method is the verdict that &ldquo;If
the light that is gone abroad on earth would permit the rearing of
temples to Venus, or Bacchus, or any of the rabble of heathen deities,
there is little doubt but that modern unbelievers would in great
numbers become their devotees; but, seeing they cannot have a God whose
worship shall accord with their inclinations, they seem determined not
to worship at all.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24201src" href=
"#xd21e24201" name="xd21e24201src">33</a> In the very next year the
same publisher began the issue of a reprint of Gibbon, with variorum
notes, edited by &ldquo;An English Churchman,&rdquo; who for the most
part defended Gibbon against his orthodox critics. This enterprise in
turn brought upon the pious publisher a fair share of odium. But the
second half of the century, albeit soon darkened by new wars in Europe,
Asia, and America, was to be for England one of Liberalism alike in
politics and in thought, free trade, and relatively free publication,
with progress in enlightenment for both the populace and the
&ldquo;educated&rdquo; classes.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.7" class="par">7. In 1858 there was elected to the
presidency of the London Secular Society the young <span class=
"sc">Charles Bradlaugh</span>, one of the greatest orators of his age,
and one of the most powerful personalities ever associated with a
progressive movement. Early experience of clerical persecution, which
even drove the boy from his father&rsquo;s roof, helped to make him a
fighter, but never infirmed his humanity. In the main self-taught, he
acquired a large measure of culture in French and English, and his rare
natural gift for debate was sharpened by a legal training. A personal
admirer of Owen, he never accepted his social polity, but was at all
times the most zealous of democratic reformers. Thenceforward the
working masses in England were in large part kept in touch with a
freethought which drew on the results of the scientific and scholarly
research of the time, and wielded a dialectic of which trained
opponents confessed the power.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24215src"
href="#xd21e24215" name="xd21e24215src">34</a> In the place of the
bland dogmatism of Owen, and the calm assumption that all mankind could
and should be schoolmastered into happiness and order, there came the
alert recognition of the absoluteness of individualism as regards
conviction, and its present pre-potency as regards social arrangements.
Every thesis was brought to the test of argument and evidence; and in
due course many who had complained that Owen would not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>argue, complained that the new school argued
everything. The essential thing was that the people were receiving
vitally needed instruction; and were being taught with a new power to
think for themselves. Incidentally they were freed from an old burden
by Bradlaugh&rsquo;s successful resistance to the demand of suretyship
from newspapers, and by his no less successful battle for the right of
non-theistic witnesses to make affirmation instead of taking the oath
in the law courts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24223src" href=
"#xd21e24223" name="xd21e24223src">35</a></p>
<p class="par">The inspiration and the instruction of the popular
movement thus maintained were at once literary, scientific, ethical,
historical, scholarly, and philosophic. Shelley was its poet; Voltaire
its first story-teller; and Gibbon its favourite historian. In
philosophy, Bradlaugh learned less from Hume than from Spinoza; in
Biblical criticism&mdash;himself possessing a working knowledge of
Hebrew&mdash;he collated the work of English and French specialists,
down to and including Colenso, applying all the while to the
consecrated record the merciless tests of a consistent ethic. At the
same time, the whole battery of argument from the natural sciences was
turned against traditionalism and supernaturalism, alike in the
lectures of Bradlaugh and the other speakers of his party, and in the
pages of his journal, <i>The National Reformer</i>. The general outcome
was an unprecedented diffusion of critical thought among the English
masses, and a proportionate antagonism to those who had wrought such a
result. When, therefore, Bradlaugh, as deeply concerned for political
as for intellectual righteousness, set himself to the task of entering
Parliament, he commenced a struggle which shortened his life, though it
promoted his main objects. Not till after a series of electoral
contests extending over twelve years was he elected for Northampton in
1880; and the House of Commons in a manner enacted afresh the long
resistance made to him in that city.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e24234src" href="#xd21e24234" name="xd21e24234src">36</a> When,
however, on his election in 1880, the Conservative Opposition began the
historic proceedings over the Oath question, they probably did even
more to deepen and diffuse the popular freethought movement than
Bradlaugh himself had done in the whole of his previous career. The
process was furthered by the policy of prosecuting and imprisoning
(1883) Mr. G. W. Foote, editor of the <i>Freethinker</i>, under the
Blasphemy Laws&mdash;a course not directly ventured on as against
Bradlaugh, though it was sought to connect him with the publication of
Mr. Foote&rsquo;s journal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href=
"#pb401" name="pb401">401</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">To this day it is common to give a false account of the
origin of the episode, representing Bradlaugh as having
&ldquo;forced&rdquo; his opinions on the attention of the House. Rather
he strove unduly to avoid wounding religious feeling. Wont to make
affirmation by law in the courts of justice, he held that the same law
applied to the &ldquo;oath of allegiance,&rdquo; and felt that it would
be unseemly on his part to use the words of adjuration if he could
legally affirm. On this point he expressly consulted the law officers
of the Crown, and they gave the opinion that he had the legal right,
which was his own belief as a lawyer. The faction called the
&ldquo;fourth party,&rdquo; however, saw an opportunity to embarrass
the Gladstone Government by challenging the act of affirmation, and
thus arose the protracted struggle. Only when a committee of the House
decided that he could not properly affirm did Bradlaugh propose to take
the oath, in order to take his seat.</p>
<p class="par">The pretence of zeal for religion, made by the
politicians who had raised the issue, was known by all men to be the
merest hypocrisy. Lord Randolph Churchill, who distinguished himself by
insisting on the moral necessity for a belief in &ldquo;some divinity
or other,&rdquo; is recorded to have professed a special esteem for Mr.
(now Lord) Morley, the most distinguished Positivist of his
time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24248src" href="#xd21e24248" name=
"xd21e24248src">37</a> The whole procedure, in Parliament and out, was
so visibly that of the lowest political malice, exploiting the crudest
religious intolerance, that it turned into active freethinkers many who
had before been only passive doubters, and raised the secularist party
to an intensity of zeal never before seen. At no period in modern
British history had there been so constant and so keen a platform
propaganda of unbelief; so unsparing an indictment of Christian
doctrine, history, and practice; such contemptuous rebuttal of every
Christian pretension; such asperity of spirit against the creed which
was once more being championed by chicanery, calumny, and injustice. In
those five years of indignant warfare were sown the seeds of a more
abundant growth of rationalism than had ever before been known in the
British Islands. With invincible determination Bradlaugh fought his
case through Parliament and the law courts, incurring debts which
forced upon him further toils that clearly shortened his life, but
never yielding for an instant in his battle with the bigotry of half
the nation. Liberalism was shamed by many defections; Conservatism,
with the assent of Mr. Balfour, was solid for injustice;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e24251src" href="#xd21e24251" name=
"xd21e24251src">38</a> and in the entire Church of England less
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>than a dozen priests stood for tolerance. But
the cause at stake was indestructible. When Bradlaugh at length took
the oath and his seat in 1886, under a ruling of the new Speaker (Peel)
which stultified the whole action of the Speaker and majorities of the
previous Parliament, and no less that of the law courts,
straightforward freethought stood three-fold stronger in England than
in any previous generation. Apart from their educative work, the
struggles and sufferings of the secularist leaders won for Great
Britain the abolition within one generation of the old burden of
suretyship on newspapers, and of the disabilities of non-theistic
witnesses; the freedom of public meeting in the London parks; the right
of avowed atheists to sit in Parliament (Bradlaugh having secured in
1888 their title to make affirmation instead of oath); and the virtual
discredit of the Blasphemy Laws as such. It is probable also that the
treatment meted out to Mrs. <span class="sc">Besant</span>&mdash;then
associated with Bradlaugh in freethought propaganda&mdash;marked the
end of another form of tyrannous outrage, already made historic in the
case of Shelley. Secured the custody of her children under a marital
deed of separation, she was deprived of it at law (1879) on her avowal
of atheistic opinions, with the result that her influence as a
propagandist was immensely increased.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.8" class="par">8. The special energy of the English
secularist movement in the ninth decade was partly due to the fact that
by that time there had appeared a remarkable amount of modern
freethinking literature of high literary and intellectual quality, and
good &ldquo;social&rdquo; status. Down to 1870 the new literary names
committed to the rejection of Christianity, apart from the men of
science who kept to their own work, were the theists Hennell, F. W.
Newman, W. E. Greg, R. W. Mackay, Buckle, and W. E. H. Lecky, all of
them influential, but none of them at once recognized as a first-rate
force. But with the appearance of Lecky&rsquo;s <i>History of the Rise
and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe</i> (1865),
lacking though it was in clearness of thought, a new tone began to
prevail; and his <i>History of European Morals from Augustus to
Charlemagne</i> (1869), equally readable and not more uncompromising,
was soon followed by a series of powerful pronouncements of a more
explicit kind. One of the first of the literary class to come forward
with an express impeachment of Christianity was <span class=
"sc">Moncure Daniel Conway</span>, whose <i>Earthward Pilgrimage</i>
(1870) was the artistic record of a gifted preacher&rsquo;s progress
from Wesleyan Methodism, through Unitarianism, to a theism which was
soon to pass into agnosticism. In 1871 appeared the remarkable work of
<span class="sc">Winwood Reade</span>, <i>The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>Martyrdom of Man</i>, wherein a rapid survey of
ancient and medieval history, and of the growth of religion from savage
beginnings, leads up to a definitely anti-theistic presentment of the
future of human life with the claim to have shown &ldquo;that the
destruction of Christianity is essential to the interests of
civilization.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24282src" href=
"#xd21e24282" name="xd21e24282src">39</a> Some eighteen editions tell
of the acceptance won by the book. Less vogue, but some startled
notice, was won by the Duke of Somerset&rsquo;s <i>Christian Theology
and Modern Scepticism</i> (1872), a work of moderate rationalism, but
by a peer. In 1873 appeared <span class="sc">Herbert
Spencer&rsquo;s</span> <i>Introduction to the Study of Sociology</i>,
wherein the implicit anti-supernaturalism of that philosopher&rsquo;s
<i>First Principles</i> was advanced upon, in the chapter on &ldquo;The
Theological Bias,&rdquo; by a mordant attack on that Christian
creed.</p>
<p class="par">That attack had been preceded by Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s
<i>Literature and Dogma</i> (1872), wherein the publicist who had
censured Colenso for not writing in Latin described the Christian
doctrine of the Trinity as &ldquo;the fairy-tale of three Lord
Shaftesburys.&rdquo; Much pleading for the recognition by unbelievers
of the value of the Bible failed to convince Christians of the value of
such a thinker&rsquo;s Christianity. A more important sensation was
provided in 1873 by the posthumous publication of Mill&rsquo;s
<i>Autobiography</i>, and, in the following year, by his <i>Three
Essays on Religion</i>, which exhibited its esteemed author as not only
not a Christian but as never having been one, although he formulated a
species of limited liability theism, as unsatisfactory to the
rationalists as to the orthodox. Still the fresh manifestations of
freethinking multiplied. On the one hand the massive treatise entitled
<i>Supernatural Religion</i> (1874), and on the other the freethinking
essays of Prof. W. K. Clifford in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, the
most vigorously outspoken ever yet written by an English academic,
showed that the whole field of debate was being reopened with a new
power and confidence. The <i>History of English Thought in the
Eighteenth Century</i>, by Leslie Stephen (1876), set up the same
impression from another side; yet another social sensation was created
by the appearance of Viscount <span class="sc">Amberley&rsquo;s</span>
<i>Analysis of Religious Belief</i> (1877); and all the while the
&ldquo;Higher Criticism&rdquo; proceeded within the pale of the
Church.</p>
<p class="par">The literary situation was now so changed that, whereas
from 1850 to 1880 the &ldquo;sensations&rdquo; in the religious world
were those made by rationalistic attacks, thereafter they were those
made by new defences. H. Drummond&rsquo;s <i>Natural Law in the
Spiritual World</i> (1883), Mr. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404"
href="#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>Balfour&rsquo;s <i>Defence of
Philosophic Doubt</i> (1879) and <i>Foundations of Belief</i> (1895),
and Mr. Kidd&rsquo;s <i>Social Evolution</i> (1894), were successively
welcomed as being declared to render such a service. It is doubtful
whether they are to-day valued upon that score in any quarter.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.9" class="par">9. In the first half of the century
popular forms of freethought propaganda were hardly possible in other
European countries. France had been too long used to regulation alike
under the monarchy and under the empire to permit of open promotion of
unbelief in the early years of the Restoration. Yet as early as 1828 we
find the Protestant Coquerel avowing that in his day the Bourbonism of
the Catholic clergy had revived the old anti-clericalism, and that it
was common to find the most high-minded patriots unbelievers and
materialists.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24342src" href="#xd21e24342"
name="xd21e24342src">40</a> But still more remarkable was the
persistence of deep freethinking currents in the Catholic world
throughout the century. About 1830 rationalism had become normal among
the younger students at Paris;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24348src"
href="#xd21e24348" name="xd21e24348src">41</a> and the revolution of

href="#xd21e24397" name="xd21e24397src">45</a> of Dupuis&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr">Origine de tous les Cultes</i> served to maintain among
the more intelligent of the proletariat an almost scientific
rationalism, which can hardly be said to have been improved on by such
historiography as that of Renan&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Vie de
J&eacute;sus</i>. And there were other forces, over and above
freemasonry, which in France and other Latin countries has since the
Revolution been steadily anti-clerical. The would-be social
reconstructor <span class="sc">Charles Fourier</span> (1772&ndash;1837)
was an independent and non-Christian though not an anti-clerical
theist, and his system may have counted for something as organizing the
secular spirit among the workers in the period of the monarchic and
Catholic reaction. Fourier approximated to Christianity inasmuch as he
believed in a divine Providence; but like Owen he had an unbounded and
heterodox faith in human <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href=
"#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>goodness and perfectibility; and
he claimed to have discovered the &ldquo;plan of God&rdquo; for men.
But Fourier was never, like Owen, a popular force; and popular
rationalism went on other lines. At no time was the proletariat of
Paris otherwise than largely Voltairean after the Revolution, of which
one of the great services (carried on by Napoleon) was an improvement
in popular education. The rival non-Christian systems of <span class=
"sc">Saint-Simon</span> (1760&ndash;1823) and <span class="sc">Auguste
Comte</span> (1798&ndash;1857) also never took any practical hold among
them; but throughout the century they have been fully the most
freethinking working-class population in the world.</p>

<p class="par">The generation after the fall of Napoleon was
pre-eminently the period of new schemes of society; and it is
noteworthy that they were all non-Christian, though all, including even
Owen&rsquo;s, claimed to provide a &ldquo;religion,&rdquo; and the
French may seem all to have been convinced by Napoleon&rsquo;s practice
that some kind of cult must be provided for the peoples. Owen alone
rejected alike supernaturalism and cultus; and his movement left the
most definite rationalistic traces. All seem to have been generated by
the double influence of (1) the social failure of the French
Revolution, which left so many anxious for another and better effort at
reconstruction, and (2) of the spectacle of the rule of Napoleon, which
seems to have elicited new ideals of beneficent autocracy. Owen,
Fourier, Saint-Simon, and Comte were all alike would-be founders of a
new society or social religion. It seems probable that this proclivity
to systematic reconstruction, in a world which still carried a
panic-memory of one great social overturn, helped to lengthen the rule
of orthodoxy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>Considerably more progress was made when
freethought became detached from special plans of polity, and grew up
anew by way of sheer truth-seeking on all the lines of inquiry.</p>
<p class="par">In France, however, the freethinking tradition from the
eighteenth century never passed away, at least as regards the life of
the great towns. And while Napoleon III made it his business to
conciliate the Church, which in the person of the somewhat
latitudinarian Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, had endorsed his <i lang=

under his rule the irreversible movement of freethought revealed itself
among his own ministers. Victor Duruy, the eminent historian, his
energetic Minister of Education, was a freethinker, non-aggressive
towards the Church, but perfectly determined not to permit aggression
by it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24473src" href="#xd21e24473" name=
"xd21e24473src">47</a> And when the Church, in its immemorial way,
declaimed against all forms of rationalistic teaching in the colleges,
and insisted on controlling the instruction in all the
schools,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24478src" href="#xd21e24478" name=
"xd21e24478src">48</a> his firm resistance made him one of its most
hated antagonists. Even in the Senate, then the asylum of all forms of
antiquated thought and prejudice, Duruy was able to carry his point
against the prelates, Sainte-Beuve strongly and skilfully supporting
him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24483src" href="#xd21e24483" name=
"xd21e24483src">49</a> Thus in the France of the Third Empire, on the
open field of the educational battle-ground between faith and reason,
the rationalistic advance was apparent in administration no less than
in the teaching of the professed men of science and the polemic of the
professed critics of religion.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.10" class="par">10. In other Catholic countries the
course of popular culture in the first half of the century was not
greatly dissimilar to that seen in France, though less rapid and
expansive. Thus we find the Spanish Inquisitor-General in 1815
declaring that &ldquo;all the world sees with horror the rapid progress
of unbelief,&rdquo; and denouncing &ldquo;the errors and the new and
dangerous doctrines&rdquo; which have passed from other countries to
Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24490src" href="#xd21e24490" name=
"xd21e24490src">50</a> This evolution was to some extent checked; but
in the latter half of the century, especially in the last thirty years,
all the Catholic countries of Europe were more or less permeated with
demotic freethought, usually going hand in hand with republican or
socialistic propaganda in politics. It is indeed a significant fact
that freethought propaganda is often most active in countries where the
Catholic Church is most powerful. Thus in Belgium there are at least
three separate federations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href=
"#pb407" name="pb407">407</a>]</span>standing for hundreds of
freethinking &ldquo;groups&rdquo;; in Spain, a few years ago, there
were freethought societies in all the large towns, and at least
half-a-dozen freethought journals; in Portugal there have been a number
of societies&mdash;a weekly journal, <i>O Secolo</i>, of Lisbon, and a
monthly review, <i lang="fr">O Livre Exame</i>. In France and Italy,
where educated society is in large measure rationalistic, the Masonic
lodges do most of the personal and social propaganda; but there are
federations of freethought societies in both countries. In Switzerland
freethought is more aggressive in the Catholic than in the Protestant
cantons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24504src" href="#xd21e24504" name=
"xd21e24504src">51</a> In the South American republics, again, as in
Italy and France, the Masonic lodges are predominantly freethinking;
and in Peru there was, a few years ago, a Freethought League, with a
weekly organ. As long ago as 1856 the American diplomatist and
arch&aelig;ologist, Squier, wrote that, &ldquo;Although the people of
Honduras, in common with those of Central America in general, are
nominally Catholics, yet, among those capable of reflection or
possessed of education, there are more who are destitute of any fixed
creed&mdash;Rationalists or, as they are sometimes called,
Freethinkers, than adherents of any form of religion.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e24513src" href="#xd21e24513" name=
"xd21e24513src">52</a> That the movement is also active in the other
republics of the southern continent may be inferred from the facts that
a Positivist organization has long subsisted in Brazil; that its
members were active in the peaceful revolution which there substituted
a republic for a monarchy; and that at the Freethought Congresses of
Rome and Paris in 1904 and 1905 there was an energetic demand for a
Congress at Buenos Aires, which was finally agreed to for 1906.</p>
<p class="par">While popular propaganda is hardly possible save on
political lines, freethinking journalism has counted for much in the
most Catholic parts of Southern Europe. The influence of such journals
is to be measured not by their circulation, which is never great, but
by their keeping up a habit of more or less instructed freethinking
among readers, to many of whom the instruction is not otherwise easily
accessible. Probably the least ambitious of them is an intellectual
force of a higher order than the highest grade of popular religious
journalism; while some of the stronger, as <i lang="nl">De Dageraad</i>
of Amsterdam, have ranked as high-class serious reviews. In the more
free and progressive countries, however, freethought affects all
periodical literature; and in France it partly permeates the ordinary
newspapers. In England, where a series of monthly or weekly
publications of an emphatically freethinking sort has been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=

"xd21e24527src">53</a> new ones rising in place of those which
succumbed to the commercial difficulties, such periodicals suffer an
economic pinch in that they cannot hope for much income from
advertisements, which are the chief sustenance of popular journals and
magazines. The same law holds elsewhere; but in England and America the
high-priced reviews have been gradually opened to rationalistic
articles, the way being led by the English <i>Westminster
Review</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e24541src" href="#xd21e24541"
name="xd21e24541src">54</a> and <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, both founded
with an eye to freer discussion.</p>

Bradlaugh&rsquo;s <i>National Reformer</i>, begun in 1860, lasted till
1893. Mr. Foote&rsquo;s <i>Freethinker</i>, begun in 1881, still
subsists. Various freethinking monthlies have risen and fallen since
1880&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Our Corner</i>, edited by Mrs. Besant,
1883&ndash;88; <i>The Liberal</i> and <i>Progress</i>, edited by Mr.
Foote, 1879&ndash;87; the <i>Free Review</i>, transformed into the
<i>University Magazine</i>, 1893&ndash;1898. The <i>Reformer</i>, a
monthly, edited by Mrs. Bradlaugh Bonner, subsisted from 1897 to 1904.
<i>The Literary Guide</i>, which began as a small sheet in 1885,
flourishes. Since 1900, a popular Socialist journal, <i>The
Clarion</i>, has declared for rationalism through the pen of its
editor, Mr. R. Blatchford (&ldquo;Nunquam&rdquo;), whose polemic has
caused much controversy. For a generation back, further, rationalistic
essays have appeared from time to time not only in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> (founded by G. H. Lewes, and long edited by Mr. John (now
Lord) Morley, much of whose writing on the French <i lang=
"fr">philosophes</i> appeared in its pages), but in the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i>, wherein was carried on, for instance, the famous
controversy between Mr. Gladstone and Prof. Huxley. In the early
&lsquo;seventies, the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, under the editorship of
Leslie Stephen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409"

<i>Literature and Dogma</i> and <i>St. Paul and Protestantism</i>. In
the latter years of the century quite a number of reviews, some of them
short-lived, gave space to advanced opinions. But propaganda has
latterly become more and more a matter of all-pervading literary
influence, the immense circulation of the sixpenny reprints of the R.

the reach of all.</p>

<p id="ch21.1.11" class="par">11. In Germany, as we have seen, the
relative selectness of culture, the comparative aloofness of the
&ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; from the mass of the people, made possible
after the War of Independence a certain pietistic reaction, in the
absence of any popular propagandist machinery or purpose on the side of
the rationalists. In the opinion of an evangelical authority, at the
beginning of the nineteenth century, &ldquo;through modern
enlightenment (<i lang="de">Aufkl&auml;rung</i>) the people had become
indifferent to the Church; the Bible was regarded as a merely human
book, the Saviour merely as a person who had lived and taught long ago,
not as one whose almighty presence is with his people
still.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24666src" href="#xd21e24666"

&ldquo;before the war, the indifference to the word of God which

after it, a desire for the Scriptures was everywhere
felt.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24675src" href="#xd21e24675"
name="xd21e24675src">56</a> This involves an admission that the

"#xd21e24683" name="xd21e24683src">57</a> (1799) was not really a
Christian revival at all. Schleiermacher himself in 1803 declared that
in Prussia there was almost no attendance on public worship, and the
clergy had fallen into profound discredit.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e24689src" href="#xd21e24689" name="xd21e24689src">58</a> A

ascendancy;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24695src" href="#xd21e24695"
name="xd21e24695src">59</a> and seeing that the freethinking of the
previous generation had been in part associated with French opinion, it
was natural that on this side anti-French feeling should promote a
reversion to older and more &ldquo;national&rdquo; forms of feeling.
Thus after the fall of Napoleon the tone of the students who had fought
in the war seems to have been more religious than that of previous
years.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24701src" href="#xd21e24701" name=

revival did not turn back the course of progress. &ldquo;When the third

religious matters.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24709src" href=

the rationalists or &ldquo;Friends of Light&rdquo; and the
Scripturalists of the old school; and the effect was a general
disintegration of orthodoxy, despite, or it may be largely in virtue

their opponents in the way of official appointments.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e24722src" href="#xd21e24722" name="xd21e24722src">63</a> The
Prussian measure (1817) of forcibly uniting the Lutheran and

"xd21e24727src">64</a> and when the new revolutionary movement broke
out in 1848, popular feeling was substantially non-religious. &ldquo;In
the south of Germany especially the conflict of political opinions and
revolutionary tendencies produced, in the first instance, an entire
prostration of religious sentiment.&rdquo; The bulk of society showed
entire indifference to worship, the churches being everywhere deserted;
and &ldquo;atheism was openly avowed, and Christianity ridiculed as the
invention of priestcraft.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24730src"
href="#xd21e24730" name="xd21e24730src">65</a> One result was a
desperate effort of the clergy to &ldquo;effect a union among all who
retained any measure of Christian belief, in order to raise up their
national religion and faith from the lowest state into which it has
ever fallen since the French Revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the clerical effort evoked a counter effort.
Already, in 1846, official interference with freedom of utterance led
to the formation of a &ldquo;free religious&rdquo; society by Dr. Rupp,
of K&ouml;nigsberg, one of the &ldquo;Friends of Light&rdquo; in the

pressure, social and official, which ensued on the collapse of the
revolution of 1848, these societies failed to develop on the scale of
their beginnings; and that of Magdeburg, which at the outset had 7,000
members, has latterly only 500; though that of Berlin has nearly
4,000.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24738src" href="#xd21e24738" name=

some fifty thousand, may be held to represent the militant side of
popular freethought in Germany. This, however, constitutes only a
fraction of the total amount of passive rationalism. There is a large
measure of enlightenment in both the working and the middle classes;
and the ostensible force of orthodoxy among the official and conformist
middle class is in many respects illusory. The German police laws put a
rigid check on all manner of platform and press propaganda which could
be indicted as hurting the feelings of religious people; so that a jest
at the Holy Coat of Tr&egrave;ves could even in recent years send a
journalist to jail, and the platform work of the militant societies is
closely trammelled. Yet there are, or have been, over a dozen journals

were avowed atheists, the former even going so far as to avow

conditions in Russia and the Scandinavian States it is the more
significant that in all alike rationalism is latterly common among the
educated classes. In Norway the latter perhaps include a larger
proportion of working people than can be so classed even in Germany;
and rationalism is relatively hopeful, though social freedom is still
far from perfect. It is the old story of toleration for a dangerously
well-placed freethought, and intolerance for that which reaches the
common people. In Russia rationalism has before it the task of
transmuting a system of autocracy into one of self-government. In no
European country, perhaps, is rationalism more general among the
educated classes; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413"

<p id="ch21.1.13" class="par">13. &ldquo;Free-religious&rdquo;
societies, such as have been noted in Germany, may be rated as forms of
moderate freethought propaganda, and are to be found in all Protestant
countries, with all shades of development. A movement of the kind has
existed for a number of years back in America, in the New England
States and elsewhere, and may be held to represent a theistic or
agnostic thought too advanced to adhere even to the Unitarianism which
during the two middle quarters of the century was perhaps the
predominant creed in New England. The Theistic Church conducted by the
Rev. Charles Voysey after his expulsion from the Church of England in
1871 to his death in 1912, and since then by the Rev. Dr. Walter Walsh,
is an example. Another type of such a gradual and peaceful evolution is
the South Place Institute (formerly &ldquo;Chapel&rdquo;) of London,
where, under the famous orator W. J. Fox, nominally a Unitarian, there
was preached between 1824 and 1852 a theism tending to pantheism,
perhaps traceable to elements in the doctrine of Priestley, and passed
on by Mr. Fox to Robert Browning.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24906src"
href="#xd21e24906" name="xd21e24906src">83</a> In 1864 the charge
passed to <span class="sc">Moncure D. Conway</span>, under whom the
congregation quietly advanced during twenty years from Unitarianism to
a non-scriptural rationalism, embracing the shades of philosophic
theism, agnosticism, and anti-theism. In Conway&rsquo;s <i>Lessons for
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span>Day</i> will be found a series of peculiarly
vivid mementos of that period, a kind of itinerary, more intimate than
any retrospective record. The latter part of his life, partly preserved
in one of the most interesting autobiographies of the century, was
spent between England and the United States and in travel. After his
first withdrawal to the States in 1884 the Institute became an open
platform for rationalist and non-theological ethics and social and
historical teaching, and it now stands as an &ldquo;Ethical
Society&rdquo; in touch with the numerous groups so named which have
come into existence in England in the last dozen years on lines
originally laid down by Dr. Felix Adler in New York. At the time of the
present writing the English societies of this kind number between
twenty and thirty, the majority being in London and its environs. Their
open adherents, who are some thousands strong, are in most cases
non-theistic rationalists, and include many former members of the
Secularist movement, of which the organization has latterly dwindled.
On partly similar lines there were developed in provincial towns about
the end of the century a small number of &ldquo;Labour Churches,&rdquo;
in which the tendency was to substitute a rationalist humanitarian
ethic for supernaturalism; and the same lecturers frequently spoke from
their platforms and from those of Ethical and Secularist societies. Of
late, however, the Labour Churches have tended to disappear. All this
means no resumption of church-going, but, by the confession of the
Churches, a completer secularization of the Sunday.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.14" class="par">14. Alongside of the lines of movement
before sketched, there has subsisted in England during the greater part
of the nineteenth century a considerable organization of Unitarianism.
In the early years of the nineteenth century it was strong enough to
obtain the repeal (1813) of the penal laws against anti-Trinitarianism,
whereafter the use of the name &ldquo;Unitarian&rdquo; became more
common, and a sect so called was founded formally in 1825. When the
heretical preachers of the Presbyterian sect began openly to declare
themselves as Unitarians, there naturally arose a protest from the
orthodox, and an attempt was made in 1833 to save from its new
destination the property owned by the heretical congregations.<a class=

Chapels Act of 1844, which gave to each group singly the power to
interpret its trust in its own fashion. Thenceforward the sect
prospered considerably, albeit not so greatly as in <span class=

United States. During the century English Unitarianism has been
associated with scholarship through such names as John Kenrick and
Samuel Sharpe, the historians of Egypt, and J. J. Tayler; and, less
directly, with philosophy in the person of Dr. James Martineau, who,
however, was rather a coadjutor than a champion of the sect. In the
United States the movement, greatly aided to popularity by the eloquent
humanism of the two Channings, lost the prestige of the name of
Emerson, who had been one of its ministers, by the inability of his
congregation to go the whole way with him in his opinions. In 1853
Emerson told the young Moncure Conway that &ldquo;the Unitarian
Churches were stated to be no longer producing ministers equal to their
forerunners, but were more and more finding their best men in those
coming from orthodox Churches,&rdquo; who &ldquo;would, of course, have
some enthusiasm for their new faith.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

however, involves rather a weakening than a strengthening of the
smaller body; though some of its teachers are to the full as bigoted
and embittered in their propaganda as the bulk of the traditionally
orthodox. Others adhere to their ritual practices in the spirit of use
and wont, as Emerson found when he sought to rationalize in his own
Church the usage of the eucharist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24951src"

numbers have passed from Unitarianism to thoroughgoing rationalism; and

South Place Chapel, have latterly reached a position scarcely
distinguishable from that of the Ethical Societies.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.15" class="par">15. A partly similar evolution has taken
place among the Protestant Churches of France, Switzerland, Hungary,
and Holland. French Protestantism could not but be intellectually moved
by the intense ferment of the Revolution; and, when finally secured
against active oppression from the Catholic side, could not but develop
an intellectual opposition to the Catholic Reaction after 1815. In
Switzerland, always in intellectual touch with France and Germany, the
tendencies which had been stamped as Socinian in the days of Voltaire
soon reasserted themselves so strongly as to provoke fanatical
reaction.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24959src" href="#xd21e24959" name=
"xd21e24959src">88</a> The nomination of Strauss to a chair of theology
at Z&uuml;rich by a Radical Government in 1839 actually gave rise to a
violent revolt, inflamed and led by Protestant clergymen. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>Executive Council were expelled, and a number of
persons killed in the strife.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24970src"
href="#xd21e24970" name="xd21e24970src">89</a> In the canton of Aargau
in 1841, again, the cry of &ldquo;religion in danger&rdquo; sufficed to
bring about a Catholic insurrection against a Liberal Council; and yet
again in 1844 it led, among the Catholics of the Valais canton, to the
bloodiest insurrection of all. Since these disgraceful outbreaks the
progress of Rationalism in Switzerland has been steady. In 1847 a chair
was given at Berne to the rationalistic scholar Zeller, without any
such resistance as was made to Strauss at Z&uuml;rich. In 1892, out of
a total number of 3,151 students in the five universities of
Switzerland and in the academies of Fribourg and Neuch&acirc;tel, the
number of theological students was only 374, positively less than that
of the teaching staff, which was 431. Leaving out the academies named,
which had no medical faculty, the number of theological students stood
at 275 out of 2,917. The Church in Switzerland has thus undergone the
relative restriction in power and prestige seen in the other European
countries of long-established culture. The evolution, however, remains
negative rather than positive. Though a number of pastors latterly call
themselves <i lang="fr">libres penseurs</i> or <i lang="fr">penseurs
libres</i>, and a movement of ethical culture (<i lang="fr">morale
sociale</i>) has made progress, the forces of positive freethought are
not numerically strong. An economic basis still supports the Churches,
and the lack of it leaves rationalism non-aggressive.<a class="noteref"

<p class="par">A somewhat similar state of things exists in Holland,
where the &ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo; of both the Old and New
Testaments made notable progress in the middle decades of the century.
There then resulted not only an extensive decay of orthodoxy within the
Protestant Church, but a movement of aggressive popular freethought,
which was for a number of years well represented in journalism. To-day,
orthodoxy and freethought are alike less demonstrative; the broad
explanation being that the Dutch people in the mass has ceased to be
pietistic, and has secularized its life. Even in the Bible-loving Boer
Republic of South Africa (Transvaal), in its time one of the most
orthodox of the civilized communities of the world, there was seen in
the past generation the phenomenon of an agnostic ex-clergyman&rsquo;s
election to the post of president, in the person of T. F. Burgers, who
succeeded Pretorius in 1871. His election was of course on political
and not on religious grounds; and panic fear on the score of his
heresy, besides driving some fanatics <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb417" href="#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span>to emigrate, is said
to have disorganized a Boer expedition under his command;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e25005src" href="#xd21e25005" name=
"xd21e25005src">91</a> but his views were known when he was elected. In
the years 1899&ndash;1902 the terrible experience of the last Boer War,
in South Africa as in Britain, perhaps did more to turn critical minds
against supernaturalism than was accomplished by almost any other
agency in the same period. In Britain the overturn was by way of the
revolt of many ethically-minded Christians against the attitude of the
orthodox churches, which were so generally and so unscrupulously
belligerent as to astonish many even of their freethinking
opponents.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25011src" href="#xd21e25011"
name="xd21e25011src">92</a> As regards the Boers and the Cape Dutch the
resultant unbelief was among the younger men, who harassed their elders
with challenges as to the justice or the activity of a God who
permitted the liberties of his most devoted worshippers to be wantonly
destroyed. Among the more educated burghers in the Orange Free State
commandos unbelief asserted itself with increasing force and
frequency.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25014src" href="#xd21e25014"
name="xd21e25014src">93</a> An ethical rationalism thus motived is not
likely to be displaced; and the Christian churches of Britain have thus
the sobering knowledge that the war which they so vociferously
glorified<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25017src" href="#xd21e25017" name=
"xd21e25017src">94</a> has wrought to the discredit of their creed
alike in their own country and among the vanquished.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.16" class="par">16. The history of popular freethought in
Sweden yields a good illustration, in a compact form,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e25028src" href="#xd21e25028" name="xd21e25028src">95</a> of
the normal play of forces and counter-forces. Since the day of
Christina, as we saw, though there have been many evidences of passive
unbelief, active rationalism has been little known in her kingdom down
till modern times, Sweden as a whole having been little touched by the
great ferment of the eighteenth century. The French Revolution,
however, stirred the waters there as elsewhere. Tegn&eacute;r, the
poet-bishop, author of the once-famous <i>Frithiof&rsquo;s Saga</i>,
was notable in his day for a determined rejection of the evangelical
doctrine of salvation; and his letters contain much criticism of the
ruling system. But the first recognizable champion of freethought in
Sweden is the thinker and historian E. G. Geijer (d. 1847), whose
history of his native land is one of the best European performances of
his generation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418"
name="pb418">418</a>]</span>In 1820 he was prosecuted for his attack
upon the dogmas of the Trinity and redemption&mdash;long the special
themes of discussion in Sweden&mdash;in his book <i>Thorild</i>; but
was acquitted by the jury. Thenceforth Sweden follows the general
development of Europe. In 1841 Strauss&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Leben
Jesu</i> was translated in Swedish, and wrought its usual effect. On
the popular side the poet Wilhelm von Braun carried on an anti-Biblical
warfare; and a blacksmith in a provincial town contrived to print in
1850 a translation of Paine&rsquo;s <i>Age of Reason</i>. Once more the
spirit of persecution blazed forth, and he was prosecuted and
imprisoned. H. B. Palmaer (d. 1854) was likewise prosecuted for his
satire, <i>The Last Judgment in Cocaigne</i> (Kr&auml;kwinkel), with
the result that his defence extended his influence. In the same period
the Stockholm curate Nils Ignell (d. 1864) produced a whole series of
critical pamphlets and a naturalistic <i>History of the Development of
Man</i>, besides supplying a preface to the Swedish translation of
Renan&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Vie de J&eacute;sus</i>. Meantime
translations of the works of Theodore Parker, by V. Pfeiff and A. F.
Akerberg, had a large circulation and a wide influence; and the courage
of the gymnasium rector N. J. Cramer (d. 1893), author of <i>The
Farewell to the Church</i>, gave an edge to the movement. The partly
rationalistic doctrine of Victor Rydberg (d. 1895) was in comparison
uncritical, and was proportionally popular.</p>
<p class="par">On another line the books of Dr. Nils Lilja (d. 1870),
written for working people, created a current of rationalism among the
masses; and in the next generation G. J. Leufstedt maintained it by
popular lectures and by the issue of translations of Colenso,
Ingersoll, B&uuml;chner, and Renan. Hjalmar Stromer (d. 1886) did
similar platform work. Meantime the followers of Parker and Rydberg
founded in 1877 a monthly review, <i>The Truthseeker</i>, which lasted
till 1894, and an association of &ldquo;Believers in Reason,&rdquo;
closely resembling the British Ethical Societies of our own day. Among
its leading adherents has been K. P. Arnoldson, the well-known peace
advocate. Liberal clerics were now fairly numerous; Positivism,
represented by Dr. Anton Nystr&ouml;m&rsquo;s <i>General History of
Civilization</i>, played its part; and the more radical freethinking
movement, nourished by new translations, became specially active, with
the usual effect on orthodox feeling. <span class="sc">August
Strindberg</span>, author and lecturer, was prosecuted in 1884 on a
charge of ridiculing the eucharist, but was declared not guilty. The
strenuous <span class="sc">Victor Lennstrand</span>, lecturer and
journalist, prosecuted in 1888 and later for his anti-Christian
propaganda, was twice fined and imprisoned, with the result of
extending his influence and discrediting his opponents. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=

by his activity, were set up in many parts of the country; and his
movement survives his death.</p>
<p id="ch21.1.17" class="par">17. Only in the United States has the
public lecture platform been made a means of propaganda to anything
like the extent seen in Britain; and the greatest part of the work in
the States has thus far been done by the late Colonel <span class=
"sc">Ingersoll</span>, the leading American orator of the last
generation, and the most widely influential platform propagandist of
the last century. No other single freethinker, it is believed, has
reached such an audience by public speech; and between his propaganda
and that of the freethought journals there has been maintained for a
generation back a large body of vigorous freethinking opinion in all
parts of the States. Before the Civil War this could hardly be said. In
the middle decades of the century the conditions had been so little
changed that after the death of President <span class=
"sc">Lincoln</span>, who was certainly a non-Christian deist, and an
agnostic deist at that,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25083src" href=
"#xd21e25083" name="xd21e25083src">96</a> it was sought to be
established that he was latterly orthodox. In his presidential campaign
of 1860 he escaped attack on his opinions simply because his opponent,
Stephen A. Douglas, was likewise an unbeliever.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25092src" href="#xd21e25092" name="xd21e25092src">97</a> The

heterodox as Lincoln.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25099src" href=

President Grant<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25102src" href="#xd21e25102"
name="xd21e25102src">99</a> was of the same cast of opinion. Such is
the general drift of intelligent thought in the United States, from
Washington onwards; and still the social conditions impose on public
men the burden of concealment, while popular history is garbled for the
same reasons. Despite the great propagandist power of the late Colonel
Ingersoll, therefore, American freethought remains dependent largely on
struggling organizations and journals,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25105src" href="#xd21e25105" name="xd21e25105src">100</a> and its
special literature is rather of the popularizing than of the scholarly
order. Nowhere else has every new advance of rationalistic science been
more angrily opposed by the priesthood; because nowhere is the ordinary
prejudice of the priest more voluble or better-bottomed in
self-complacency. As late as 1891 the Methodist Bishop Keener delivered
a ridiculous attack on the evolution theory before the &OElig;cumenical
Council of Methodism at Washington, declaring that it had been utterly
refuted by a certain &ldquo;wonderful deposit of the Ashley
beds.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25111src" href="#xd21e25111"
name="xd21e25111src">101</a> Various professors in ecclesiastical
colleges have been driven from their posts for accepting in turn the
discoveries of geology, biology, and the &ldquo;higher

true, the denounced professor has been called to a better chair; and
latterly some of the more liberal clergy have even commercially
exploited the higher criticism by producing the &ldquo;Rainbow
Bible.&rdquo; Generally speaking, however, in the United States sheer
preoccupation with business, and lack of leisure, counteract in a
measure the relative advantage of social freedom; and while culture is
more widely diffused than in England, it remains on the whole less
radical in the &ldquo;educated&rdquo; classes so-called. So far as it
is possible to make a quantitative estimate, it may be said that in the
more densely populated parts of the States there is latterly less of
studious freethinking because there is less leisure than in England;
but that in the Western States there is a relative superiority, class
for class, because of the special freedom of the conditions and the
independent character of many of the immigrants who constitute the new
populations.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25126src" href="#xd21e25126"

<p class="par first">It is within the last generation that the critical
analysis of the Jewish and Christian sacred books has been most
generally carried on; but the process has never been suspended since
the German <i lang="de">Aufkl&auml;rung</i> arose on the stimuli of
English and French deism.</p>
<p id="ch21.2.1" class="par">1. At the beginning of the century,
educated men in general believed in the Semitic myths of creation, as
given in Genesis: long before the end of it they had more or less
explicitly rectified their beliefs in the light of new natural science
and new arch&aelig;ology. The change became rapid after 1860; but it
had been led up to even in the period of reaction. While in France,
under the restored monarchy, rationalistic activity was mainly headed
into historical, philosophical, and sociological study, and in England
orthodoxy predominated in theological discussion, the German
rationalistic movement went on among the specialists, despite the
liberal religious reaction of Schleiermacher,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25143src" href="#xd21e25143" name="xd21e25143src">104</a> who
himself gave forth such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href=
"#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span>an uncertain sound. His case and
that of his father, an army chaplain, tell signally of the power of the
mere clerical occupation to develop a species of emotional belief in
one who has even attained rationalism. When the son, trained for the
church, avowed to his father (1787) that he had lost faith in the
supernatural Jesus, the father professed to mourn bitterly, but three
years later avowed that he in his own youth had preached Christianity
for twelve years while similarly disbelieving its fundamental
tenet.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25163src" href="#xd21e25163" name=
"xd21e25163src">105</a> He professionally counselled compromise, which
the son duly practised, with such success that, whereas he originally
addressed his <i>Discourses on Religion</i> (1799) to &ldquo;the
educated among its despisers,&rdquo; he was able to say in the preface
to the third edition, twenty years later (1821), that the need now was
to reason with the pietists and literalists, the ignorant and bigoted,
the credulous and superstitious.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25171src"
href="#xd21e25171" name="xd21e25171src">106</a> In short, he and others
had been able to set up a fashion of poetic religion among deists, but
not to lighten the darkness of orthodox belief.</p>
<p class="par">The ostensible religious revival associated with
Schleiermacher&rsquo;s name was in fact a reaction of temperament, akin
to the romantic movement in literature, of which Chateaubriand in
France was the exponent as regarded religious feeling. The German
&ldquo;rationalism&rdquo; of the latter part of the eighteenth century,
with its stolid translation of the miraculous into the historical, and
its official accommodation of the result to the purposes of the pulpit,
had not reached any firm scientific foundation; and Schleiermacher on
the other side, protesting that religion was a matter not of knowledge
but of feeling, attracted alike the religious emotionalists, the
seekers of compromise, and the romantics. His personal and literary
charm, and his tolerance of mundane morals, gave him a German vogue not
unlike that of Chateaubriand in France. His intellectual cast and
ultimate philosophic bias, however, together with his freedom of
private life,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25178src" href="#xd21e25178"
name="xd21e25178src">107</a> ultimately alienated him from the
orthodox, and thus it was that he died (1834) in the odour of heresy.
Heresy, in fact, he had preached from the outset; and it was only in a
highly emancipated society that his teaching could have been
fashionable. The statement that by his <i>Discourses</i> &ldquo;with
one stroke he overthrew the card-castle of rationalism and the old
fortress of orthodoxy&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25190src" href=
"#xd21e25190" name="xd21e25190src">108</a> is literally quite
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>false, for the old compromising
pseudo-rationalism survived a long while, and orthodoxy still longer;
and it is quite misleading inasmuch as it suggests a resurgence of
faith. The same historian proceeds to record that some saw in the work
&ldquo;only a slightly disguised return to superstition, and others a
brilliant confession of unbelief.&rdquo; &ldquo;The general public saw
in the Discourses a new assault of romanticism upon religion. The
clergy in particular were painfully aroused, and did not dissemble
their irritation. Spalding himself could not restrain his anger.&rdquo;
Schleiermacher&rsquo;s friend Sach, who had passed the Discourses in
manuscript, woke up to denounce them as unchristian, pantheistic, and
denuded of the ideas of God, immortality, and morality.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e25195src" href="#xd21e25195" name=
"xd21e25195src">109</a></p>
<p class="par">In England the work would have been so denounced on all
sides; and the bulk of Schleiermacher&rsquo;s teaching would there have
been reckoned revolutionary and &ldquo;godless.&rdquo; He was a lover
of both political and social freedom; and in his <i>Two Memoranda on
the Church Question in regard to Prussia</i> (1803) he made &ldquo;a
veritable declaration of war on the clerical spirit.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e25203src" href="#xd21e25203" name=
"xd21e25203src">110</a> Recognizing that ecclesiastical discipline had
reached a low ebb, he even proposed that civil marriage should precede
religious marriage, and be alone obligatory; besides planning a drastic
subjection of the Prussian Church to State regulation.<a class=

"xd21e25208src">111</a> In his pamphlet on <i>The So-called Epistle to

a &ldquo;destructive&rdquo; critic.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25216src" href="#xd21e25216" name="xd21e25216src">112</a> He

"#xd21e25222" name="xd21e25222src">113</a> Nor can it be said that,
despite his attempts in later life to reach a more definite theology,
Schleiermacher really held firmly any Christian or even theistic dogma.
He seems to have been at bottom a pantheist;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25227src" href="#xd21e25227" name="xd21e25227src">114</a> and the
secret of his attraction for so many German preachers and theologians
then and since is that he offered them in eloquent and moving diction a
kind of profession of faith which avoided alike the fatal undertaking
of the old religious rationalism to reduce the sacred narratives to
terms of reason, and the dogged refusal of orthodoxy to admit that
there was anything to explain away. Philosophically and critically
speaking, his teaching has no lasting intellectual substance, being
first a negation of intellectual tests and then a belated attempt to
apply them. It is not even original, being a development from Rousseau
and Lessing. But it had undoubtedly a freeing and civilizing influence
for many years; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423"
name="pb423">423</a>]</span>and it did little harm save insofar as it
fostered the German proclivity to the nebulous in thought and language,
and partly encouraged the normal resistance to the critical spirit. All
irrationalism, to be sure, in some sort spells self-will and
lawlessness; but the orthodox negation of reason was far more primitive
than Schleiermacher&rsquo;s. From that side, accordingly, he never had
any sympathy. When, soon after his funeral, in which his coffin was
borne and followed by troops of students, his church was closed to the
friends who wished there to commemorate him, it was fairly clear that
his own popularity lay mainly with the progressive spirits, and not
among the orthodox; and in the end his influence tended to merge in
that of the critical movement.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25235src"

<p id="ch21.2.2" class="par">2. Gradually that had developed a greater
precision of method, though there were to be witnessed repetitions of
the intellectual anomalies of the past, so-called rationalists losing
the way while supernaturalists occasionally found it. It has been
remarked by Reuss that Paulus, a clerical &ldquo;rationalist,&rdquo;
fought for the Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews in the
very year in which Tholuck, a reconverted evangelical, gave up the
Pauline authorship as hopeless; that when Schleiermacher, ostensibly a
believer in inspiration, denied the authenticity of the Epistle to
Timothy, the [theological] rationalist Wegscheider opposed him; and
that the rationalistic Eichhorn maintained the Mosaic authorship of the
Pentateuch long after the supernaturalist Vater had disproved
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25251src" href="#xd21e25251" name=
"xd21e25251src">116</a> Still the general movement was inevitably and
irrevocably rationalistic. Beginning with the Old Testament, criticism
gradually saw more and more of mere myth where of old men had seen
miracle, and where the first rationalists saw natural events
misconceived. Soon the process reached the New Testament, every
successive step being resisted in the old fashion; and much laborious
work, now mostly forgotten, was done by a whole company of scholars,
among whom Paulus, Eichhorn, De Wette, G. L. Bauer, Wegscheider,
Bretschneider, and Gabler were prominent.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">This was in some respects the high-water mark of
rational critical science for the century, inasmuch as it represented
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=
"pb424">424</a>]</span>fullest use of free judgment. The powerful and
orderly mind of Strauss, working systematically on a large body of
previous unsystematic criticism, produced something more massive and
coherent than any previous writer had achieved. It was not that he
applied any new principle. Criticism had long been slowly disengaging
itself from the primary fallacy of taking all scriptural records as
standing for facts, and explaining away the supernatural side. Step by
step it was recognized that not misinterpretation of events but
<i>mythology</i> underlay much of the sacred history. Already in 1799
an anonymous and almost unnoticed writer<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25279src" href="#xd21e25279" name="xd21e25279src">118</a> had
argued that the entire gospel story was a pre-existent conception in
the Jewish mind. In 1802 G. L. Bauer had produced a treatise on
<i>Hebrew Mythology</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25288src" href=
"#xd21e25288" name="xd21e25288src">119</a> in which not only was the
actuality of myth in Bible narrative insisted on, but the general
principle of animism in savage thought was clearly formulated. Semler
had seen that the stories of Samson and Esther were myths. Even
Eichhorn&mdash;who reduced all the Old Testament stories to natural
events misunderstood, accepted Noah and the patriarchs as historical
personages, and followed Bahrdt in making Moses light a fire on Mount
Sinai&mdash;changed his method on coming to the New Testament, and
pointed out that only indemonstrable hypotheses could be reached by
turning supernatural events into natural where there was no outside
historical evidence. Other writers&mdash;as Krug, Gabler, Kaiser,
Wegscheider, and Horst&mdash;ably pressed the mythical principle, some
of them preceding Bauer. The so-called &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
theory&mdash;which was not at all that of the
&ldquo;natural<i>ists</i>&rdquo; but the specialty of the compromising
&ldquo;rationalists&rdquo;&mdash;was thus effectively shaken by a whole
series of critics.</p>
<p class="par">But the power of intellectual habit and environment was
still strikingly illustrated in the inability of all of the critics to
shake off completely the old fallacy. Bauer explained the divine
promise to Abraham as standing for the patriarch&rsquo;s own prophetic
anticipation, set up by a contemplation of the starry heavens. Another
gave up the supernatural promise of the birth of the Baptist, but held
to the dumbness of Zechariah. Krug similarly accepted the item of the
childless marriage, and claimed to be applying the mythical principle
in taking the Magi without the star, and calling them oriental
merchants. Kaiser took the story of the fish with a coin in its mouth
as fact, while complaining of other less absurd reductions of miracle
to natural occurrences. The method of Paulus,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25298src" href="#xd21e25298" name="xd21e25298src">120</a> the
&ldquo;Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425"
name="pb425">425</a>]</span>Ev&ecirc;meros&rdquo;&mdash;who loyally
rejected all miracles, but got rid of them on the plan of explaining,
<i>e.g.</i>, that when Jesus was supposed to be walking on the water he
was really walking on the bank&mdash;was still popular, a generation
after Schleiermacher&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Reden</i>. The mythical
theory as a whole went on hesitating among definitions and
genera&mdash;saga and legend, historical myth, mythical history,
philosophical myth, poetic myth&mdash;and the differences of the
mythological school over method arrested the acceptance of their
fundamental principle.</p>
<p id="ch21.2.3" class="par">3. No less remarkable was the check to the
few attempts which had been made at clearing the ground by removing the
Fourth Gospel from the historical field. Lessing had taken this gospel
as peculiarly historical, as did Fichte and Schleiermacher and the main
body of critics after him. Only in England (by Evanson) had the case
been more radically handled. In 1820 Bretschneider, following up a few
tentative German utterances, put forth, by way of hypothesis, a general
argument<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25316src" href="#xd21e25316" name=
"xd21e25316src">121</a> to the effect that the whole presentment of
Jesus in the Fourth Gospel is irreconcilable with that of the
Synoptics, that it could not be taken as historical, and that it could
not therefore be the work of the Apostle John.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25320src" href="#xd21e25320" name="xd21e25320src">122</a> The
result was a general discussion and a general rejection. The innovation
in theory was too sudden for assimilation: and Bretschneider, finding
no support, later declared that he had been &ldquo;relieved of his
doubts&rdquo; by the discussion, and had thus attained his object.
Strauss himself, in his first <i lang="de">Leben Jesu</i>, failed to
realize the case; and it was not till the second (1863) that he
developed it, profiting by the intermediate work of F. C. Baur.</p>
<p id="ch21.2.4" class="par">4. But as regards the gospel history in
general, the first <i lang="de">Leben Jesu</i> is a great
&ldquo;advance in force&rdquo; as compared with all preceding work.
Himself holding undoubtingly to the vital assumption of the
rationalizing school that the central story of Jesus and the disciples
and the crucifixion was history, he yet applied the mythical principle
systematically to nearly all the episodes, handling the case with the
calmness of a great judge and the skill of a great critic. Even
Strauss, indeed, paid the penalty which seems so generally to attach to
the academic discipline&mdash;the lack of ultimate hold on life. After
showing that much of the gospel narrative was mere myth, and leaving
utterly problematical all the rest, he saw fit to begin and end with
the announcement that nothing really mattered&mdash;that the
<i>ideal</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>Jesus was unaffected by historic analysis, and
that it was the ideal that counted.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25339src" href="#xd21e25339" name="xd21e25339src">123</a> In a
world in which nine honest believers out of ten held that the facts
mattered everything, there could be no speedy or practical triumph for
a demonstration which thus announced its own inutility. Strauss had
achieved for New Testament criticism what Kant and Fichte and Hegel had
compassed for rational philosophy in general, ostensibly proffering
together bane and antidote. As in their case, however, so in his, the
truly critical work had an effect in despite of the theoretic
surrender. Among instructed men, historical belief in the gospels has
never been the same since Strauss wrote; and he lived to figure for his
countrymen as one of the most thoroughgoing freethinkers of his
age.</p>
<p id="ch21.2.5" class="par">5. For a time there was undoubtedly
&ldquo;reaction,&rdquo; engineered with the full power of the Prussian
State in particular. The pious Frederick William IV, already furious
against Swiss Radicalism in 1847, was moved by the revolutionary
outbreaks of 1848 to a fierce repression of everything liberal in
theological teaching. &ldquo;This dismal period of Prussian history was
the bloom-period of the Hengsterbergan theology&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e25352src" href="#xd21e25352" name=
"xd21e25352src">124</a>&mdash;the school of rabid orthodoxy. In 1854,
Eduard Zeller, bringing out in book form his work on the <i>Acts of the
Apostles</i> (originally produced in the <i>T&uuml;bingen Theological
Journal</i>, 1848&ndash;51), writes that &ldquo;The exertions of our
ecclesiastics, assisted by political reaction, have been so effectual
that the majority of our theologians not only look with suspicion or
indifference on this or that scientific opinion, but regard scientific
knowledge in general with the same feelings&rdquo;; and he leaves it an
open question &ldquo;whether time will bring a change, or whether
German Protestantism will stagnate in the Byzantine conditions towards
which it is now hastening with all sail on.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e25364src" href="#xd21e25364" name="xd21e25364src">125</a> For
his own part, Zeller abandoned the field of theology for that of
philosophy, producing a history of Greek philosophy, and one of German
philosophy since Leibnitz.</p>
<p id="ch21.2.6" class="par">6. Another expert of Baur&rsquo;s school,
Albrecht Schwegler, author of works on Montanism, the Post-Apostolic
Age, and other problems of early Christian history, and of a
<i>Handbook of the History of Philosophy</i> which for half a century
had an immense circulation, was similarly driven out of theological
research by the virulence of the reaction,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25373src" href="#xd21e25373" name="xd21e25373src">126</a> and
turned to the task of Roman history, in which he distinguished himself
as he did in every other he essayed. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb427" href="#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span>brains were being
expelled from the chairs of theology. But this very fact tended to
discredit the reaction itself; and outside of the Prussian sphere of
influence German criticism went actively on. Gustav Volkmar, turning
his back on Germany in 1854, settled in Switzerland, and in 1863 became
professor at Z&uuml;rich, where he added to his early <i lang=
"de">Religion Jesu</i> (1857) and other powerful works his treatises on
the <i>Origin of the Gospels</i> (1866), <i>The Gospels</i> (1869),
<i>Commentary on the Apocalypse</i> (1860&ndash;65), and <i>Jesus
Nazarenus</i> (1881)&mdash;all stringent critical performances,
irreconcilable with orthodoxy. Elsewhere too there was a general
resumption of progress.</p>
<p class="par">To this a certain contribution was made by <span class=
"sc">Bruno Bauer</span> (1809&ndash;1882), who, after setting out as an
orthodox Hegelian, outwent Strauss in the opposite direction. In 1838,
as a licentiate at Bonn, he produced two volumes on <i>The Religion of
the Old Testament</i>, in which the only critical element is the notion
of a &ldquo;historical evolution of revelation.&rdquo; Soon he had got
beyond belief in revelation. In 1840 appeared his <i>Critique of the
Gospel History of John</i>, and in 1841 his much more disturbing
<i>Critique of the Gospel History of the Synoptics</i>, wherein there
is substituted for Strauss&rsquo;s formula of the
&ldquo;community-mind&rdquo; working on tradition, that of individual
literary construction. Weisse and Wilcke had convinced him that Mark
was the first gospel, and Wilcke in particular that it was no mere copy
of an oral tradition but an artistic construction. As he claimed, this
was a much more &ldquo;positive&rdquo; conception than Strauss&rsquo;s,
which was fundamentally &ldquo;mysterious.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25408src" href="#xd21e25408" name="xd21e25408src">127</a>
Unfortunately, though he saw that the new position involved the
non-historicity of the Gospel Jesus, he left his own historic
conception &ldquo;mysterious,&rdquo; giving no reason why the
&ldquo;Urevangelist&rdquo; framed his romance. Bauer was
non-anthropological, and left his theory as it began, one of an
arbitrary construction by gospel-makers. Immediately after his book
appeared that of Ghillany on <i>Human Sacrifice among the ancient
Hebrews</i> (1842), which might have given him clues; but they seem to
have had for him no significance.</p>
<p class="par">As it was, his book on the Synoptics raised a great
storm; and when the official request for the views of the university
faculties as to the continuance of his licence evoked varying answers,
Bauer settled the matter by a violent attack on professional
theologians in general, and was duly expelled.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25419src" href="#xd21e25419" name="xd21e25419src">128</a> For the
rest of his long life he was a freelance, doing some relatively valid
work on the Pauline problem, but pouring out his turbid spirit in a
variety of political <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428"
name="pb428">428</a>]</span>writings, figuring by turns as an
anti-Semite (1843), a culture-historian,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25429src" href="#xd21e25429" name="xd21e25429src">129</a> and a
pre-Bismarckian imperialist, despairing of German unity, but looking
hopefully to German absorption in a vast empire of Russia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e25437src" href="#xd21e25437" name=
"xd21e25437src">130</a> Naturally he found political happiness in
1870,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25442src" href="#xd21e25442" name=

and on the glories of imperialism.</p>
<p id="ch21.2.7" class="par">7. In 1864, after an abstention of twenty
years from discussion of the problem, Strauss restated his case in a
<i>Life of Jesus, adapted for the German People</i>. Here, accepting
the contention of F. C. Baur that the proper line of inquiry was to
settle the order of composition of the synoptic gospels, and agreeing
in Baur&rsquo;s view that Matthew came first, he undertook to offer
more of positive result than was reached in his earlier research, which
simply dealt scientifically with the abundant elements of dubiety in
the records. The new procedure was really much less valid than the old.
Baur had quite unwarrantably decided that the Sermon on the Mount was
one of the most certainly genuine of the discourses ascribed to
Jesus;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25459src" href="#xd21e25459" name=
"xd21e25459src">133</a> and Strauss, while exhibiting a reserve of
doubt<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25464src" href="#xd21e25464" name=
"xd21e25464src">134</a> as to all &ldquo;such speeches,&rdquo;
nonetheless committed himself to the &ldquo;certain&rdquo; genuineness
alike of the Sermon and of the seven parables in the thirteenth chapter
of Matthew.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25469src" href="#xd21e25469"
name="xd21e25469src">135</a> Many scholars who continue to hold by the
historicity of Jesus have since recognized that the Sermon is no real
discourse, but a compilation of gnomic sayings or maxims previously
current in Jewish literature.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25473src"
href="#xd21e25473" name="xd21e25473src">136</a> Thus the certainties of
Baur and Strauss pass into the category of the cruder certainties which
Strauss impugned; and the latter left the life of Jesus an unsolved
enigma after all his analysis.</p>
<p class="par">As he himself noted, the German New Testament criticism
of the previous twenty years had &ldquo;run to seed&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e25481src" href="#xd21e25481" name=
"xd21e25481src">137</a> in a multitude of treatises on the sources,
aims, composition, and mutual relations of the Synoptics, as if these
were the final issues. They had settled nothing; and after a lapse of
fifty years the same problems are being endlessly discussed. The
scientific course for Strauss would have been to develop more radically
the method of his first <i>Life</i>: failing to do this, he made no new
contribution to the problem, though he deftly enough indicated how
little difference there was, save in formula, between Baur&rsquo;s
negations and his own. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href=
"#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Something of the explanation is to be detected in the
sub-title, &ldquo;Adapted for the German People.&rdquo; From his first
entrance into the arena he had met with endless <i lang="la">odium
theologicum</i>; being at once deprived of his post as a philosophical
lecturer at T&uuml;bingen, and virulently denounced on all hands. His
proposed appointment to a chair at Z&uuml;rich in 1839, as we have
seen, led there to something approaching a revolution. Later, he found
that acquaintance with him was made a ground of damage to his friends;
and though he had actually been elected to the Wirtemberg Diet in 1848
by his fellow citizens of Ludwigsburg town, after being defeated in his
candidature for the new parliament at Frankfort through the hostility
of the rural voters, he had abundant cause to regard himself as a
banned person in Germany. A craving for the goodwill of the people as
against the hatred of the priests was thus very naturally and
justifiably operative in the conception of his second work; and this
none the less because his fundamental political conservatism had soon
cut short his representation of radical Ludwigsburg. As he justly said,
the question of the true history of Christianity was not one for
theologians alone. But the emotional aim affected the intellectual
process. As previously in his Life of Ulrich von Hutten, he strove to
establish the proposition that the new Reformation he desired was akin
to the old; and that the Germans, as the &ldquo;people of the
Reformation,&rdquo; would show themselves true to their past by casting
out the religion of dogma and supernaturalism. Such an attempt to
identify the spirit of freethought with the old spirit of Bibliolatry
was in itself fantastic, and could not create a genuine movement,
though the book had a wide audience. The <i lang=
"de">Glaubenslehre</i>, in which he made good his maxim that &ldquo;the
true criticism of dogma is its history,&rdquo; is a sounder
performance. Strauss&rsquo;s avowed desire to write a book as suitable
to Germans as was Renan&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Vie de J&eacute;sus</i> to
Frenchmen was something less than scientific. The right book would be
written for all nations.</p>
<p class="par">Like most other Germans, Strauss exulted immensely over
the war of 1870. In what is now recognized as the national manner, he
wrote two boastful open-letters to Renan explaining that whatsoever
Germany did was right, and whatsoever France did was wrong, and that
the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine was altogether just. These
letters form an important contribution to the vast cairn of self-praise
raised by latter-day German culture. But Strauss&rsquo;s literary life
ended on a nobler note and in a higher warfare. After all his efforts
at popularity, and all his fraternization with his people on the ground
of racial animosity (not visible in his volume <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>of
lectures on <i>Voltaire</i>, written and delivered at the request of
the Princess Alice), his fundamental sincerity moved him to produce a
final &ldquo;Confession,&rdquo; under the title of <i>The Old and the
New Faith</i> (1872). It asked the questions: &ldquo;Are we still
Christians?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Have we still religion?&rdquo;; &ldquo;How
do we conceive the world?&rdquo;; &ldquo;How do we order our
life?&rdquo;; and it answered them all in a calmly and uncompromisingly
naturalistic sense, dismissing all that men commonly call religious
belief. The book as a whole is heterogeneous in respect of its two
final chapters, &ldquo;Of our Great Poets&rdquo; and &ldquo;Of our
Great Musicians,&rdquo; which seem to have been appended by way of
keeping up the attitude of national fraternity evoked by the war. But
they could not and did not avail to conciliate the theologians, who
opened fire on the book with all their old animosity, and with an
unconcealed delight in the definite committal of the great negative
critic to an attitude of practical atheism. The book ran through six
editions in as many months, and crystallized much of the indefinite
freethinking of Germany into something clearer and firmer. All the more
was it a new engine of strife and disintegration; and the aging author,
shocked but steadied by the unexpected outburst of hostility, penned a
quatrain to himself, ending: &ldquo;In storm hast thou begun; in storm
shalt thou end.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On the last day of the year he wrote an
&ldquo;afterword&rdquo; summing up his work and his position. He had
not written, he declared, by way of contending with opponents; he had
sought rather to commune with those of his own way of thinking; and to
them, he felt, he had the right to appeal to live up to their
convictions, not compromising with other opinions, and not adhering to
any Church. For his &ldquo;Confession&rdquo; he anticipated the thanks
of a more enlightened future generation. &ldquo;The time of
agreement,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;will come, as it came for the
<i lang="de">Leben Jesu</i>; only this time I shall not live to see
it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25517src" href="#xd21e25517"
name="xd21e25517src">138</a> A little more than a year later (1874) he
passed away.</p>
<p class="par">It is noteworthy that he should have held that agreement
<i>had</i> come as to the first <i lang="de">Leben Jesu</i>. He was in
fact convinced that all educated men&mdash;at least in
Germany&mdash;had ceased to believe in miracles and the supernatural,
however they might affect to conform to orthodoxy. And, broadly
speaking, this was true: all New Testament criticism of any standing
had come round to the naturalistic point of view. But, as we have seen,
the second <i lang="de">Leben Jesu</i> was far enough from reaching a
solid historical footing; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href=
"#pb431" name="pb431">431</a>]</span>and the generation which followed
made only a piecemeal and unsystematic advance to a scientific
solution.</p>
<p id="ch21.2.8" class="par">8. And it was long before even
Strauss&rsquo;s early method of scientific criticism was applied to the
initial problems of Old Testament history. The investigation lagged
strangely. Starting from the clues given by Hobbes, Spinoza, and Simon,
and above all by the suggestion of Astruc (1753) as to the twofold
element implied in the God-names Jehovah and Elohim, it had proceeded,
for sheer lack of radical skepticism, on the assumption that the
Pentateuchal history was true. On this basis, modern Old Testament
criticism of a professional kind may be said to have been founded by
Eichhorn, who hoped by a quasi-rationalistic method to bring back
unbelievers to belief.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25538src" href=
"#xd21e25538" name="xd21e25538src">139</a> Of his successors, some,
like Ilgen, were ahead of their time; some, like De Wette, failed to
make progress in their criticism; some, like Ewald, remained always
arbitrary; and some of the ablest and most original, as Vatke, failed
to co&ouml;rdinate fully their critical methods and results.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e25547src" href="#xd21e25547" name=
"xd21e25547src">140</a> Thus, despite all the German activity, little
sure progress had been made, apart from discrimination of sources,
between the issue of the <i>Critical Remarks on the Hebrew
Scriptures</i> of the Scotch Catholic priest, Dr. <span class=
"sc">Geddes</span>, in 1800, and the publication of the first part of
the work of Bishop <span class="sc">Colenso</span> on <i>The
Pentateuch</i> (1862). This, by the admission of <span class=
"sc">Kuenen</span>, who had begun as a rather narrow believer,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e25566src" href="#xd21e25566" name=
"xd21e25566src">141</a> corrected the initial error of the German
specialists by applying to the narrative the common-sense tests
suggested long before by Voltaire.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25569src"
href="#xd21e25569" name="xd21e25569src">142</a> That academic
scholarship thus wasted two generations in its determination to adhere
to the &ldquo;reverent&rdquo; method, and in its aversion to the
&ldquo;irreverence&rdquo; which proceeded on the simple power to see
facts, is a sufficient comment on the Kantian doctrine that it was the
business of scholars to adapt the sacred books to popular needs.
Tampering with the judgment of their flocks, the German theologians
injured their own.</p>
<p class="par">As of old, part of the explanation lay in the malignant
resistance of orthodoxy to every new advance. We have seen how
Strauss&rsquo;s appointment to a chair at Z&uuml;rich was met by Swiss
pietism. The same spirit sought to revert, even in
&ldquo;intellectually free&rdquo; Germany, to its old methods of
repression. The authorities of Berlin discussed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span>with
Neander the propriety of suppressing Strauss&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Leben
Jesu</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25585src" href="#xd21e25585" name=
"xd21e25585src">143</a> and after a time those who shared his views
were excluded even from philosophical chairs.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25591src" href="#xd21e25591" name="xd21e25591src">144</a> Later,
the <i>brochure</i> in which Edgar Bauer defended his brother Bruno
against his opponents (1842) was seized by the police; and in the
following year, for publishing <i>The Strife of Criticism with Church
and State</i>, the same writer was sentenced to four years&rsquo;
imprisonment. In private life, persecution was carried on in the usual
ways; and the virulence of the theological resistance recalled the
palmy days of Lutheran polemics. In the sense that the mass of
orthodoxy held its ground for the time being, the attack failed.
Naturally the most advanced and uncompromisingly scientific positions
were least discussed, the stress of dispute going on around the
criticism which modified without annihilating the main elements in the
current creed, or that which did the work of annihilation on a popular
level of thought. Only in our day is German &ldquo;expert&rdquo;
criticism beginning openly to reckon with propositions fairly and fully
made out by German writers of three or more generations back. Thus in
1781 Corodi in his <i lang="de">Geschichte des Chiliasmus</i> dwelt on
the pre-Hebraic origins of the belief in angels, in immortality, and
heaven and hell, and on the Persian derivation of the Jewish seven
archangels; Wegscheider in 1819 in his <i>Institutes of Theology</i>
indicated further connections of the same order, and cited pagan
parallels to the virgin-birth; J. A. L. Richter in the same year
pointed to Indian and Persian precedents for the Logos and many other
Christian doctrines; and several other writers, Strauss included,
pointed to both Persian and Babylonian influences on Jewish theology
and myth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25610src" href="#xd21e25610" name=
"xd21e25610src">145</a> The mythologist and Hebraist F. Korn (who wrote

<p class="par">When even these theses were in the main ignored, more
mordant doctrine was necessarily burked. Such subversive criticism of
religious history as Ghillany&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Die Menschenopfer
der alten Hebr&auml;er</i> (1842), insisting that human sacrifice had
been habitual in early Jewry, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433"
href="#pb433" name="pb433">433</a>]</span>that ritual cannibalism
underlay the paschal eucharist, found even fewer students prepared to
appreciate it than did the searching ethico-philosophical criticism
passed on the Christian creed by Feuerbach. F. Daumer,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e25652src" href="#xd21e25652" name=
"xd21e25652src">148</a> who in 1842 published a treatise on the same
lines as Ghillany&rsquo;s (<i lang="de">Der Feuer und
Molochdienst</i>), and followed it up in 1847 with another on the
Christian mysteries, nearly as drastic, wavered later in his
rationalism and avowed his conversion to a species of faith. Hence a
certain setback for his school. In France the genial German
revolutionist and exile Ewerbeck published, under the titles of
<i lang="fr">Qu&rsquo;est ce que la Religion?</i> and <i lang=
"fr">Qu&rsquo;est ce que la Bible?</i> (1850), two volumes of very
freely edited translations from Feuerbach, Daumer, Ghillany,
L&uuml;tzelberger (on the simple humanity of Jesus), and Bruno Bauer,
avowing that after vainly seeking a publisher for years he had produced
the books at his own expense. He had, however, so mutilated the
originals as to make the work ineffectual for scholars, without making
it attractive to the general public; and there is nothing to show that
his formidable-looking arsenal of explosives had much effect on
contemporary French thought, which developed on other lines.</p>
<p class="par">Old Testament criticism, nevertheless, has in the last
generation been much developed, after having long missed some of the
first lines of advance. After Colenso&rsquo;s rectification of the
fundamental error as to the historicity of the narrative of the
Pentateuch, so long and so obstinately persisted in by the German
specialists in contempt of Voltaire, the &ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo;
proceeded with such substantial certainty on the scientific lines of
<span class="sc">Kuenen</span> and <span class="sc">Wellhausen</span>
that, whereas Professor Robertson Smith had to leave the Free Church of
Scotland in 1881<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25679src" href=
"#xd21e25679" name="xd21e25679src">149</a> for propagating
Kuenen&rsquo;s views, before the century was out Canons of the English
Church were doing the work with the acquiescence of perhaps six
clergymen out of ten; and American preachers were found promoting an
edition of the Bible which exhibited some of the critical results to
the general reader. Heresy on this score had &ldquo;become
merchandise.&rdquo; Nevertheless, the professional tendency to
compromise (a result of economic and other pressures) keeps most of the
ecclesiastical critics far short of the outspoken utterances of
<span class="sc">M. M. Kalisch</span>, who in his <i>Commentary on
Leviticus</i> (1867&ndash;72) repudiates every vestige of the doctrine
of inspiration.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25692src" href="#xd21e25692"
name="xd21e25692src">150</a> Later clerical critics, notably Canon
Driver, use <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>language on that subject which cannot be read
with critical respect.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25705src" href=
"#xd21e25705" name="xd21e25705src">151</a> But among students at the
end of the century the orthodox view was practically extinct. Whereas
the defenders of the faith even a generation before habitually stood to
the &ldquo;argument from prophecy,&rdquo; the conception of prophecy as
prediction has now become meaningless as regards the so-called Mosaic
books; and the constant disclosure of interpolations and adaptations in
the others has discredited it as regards the &ldquo;prophets&rdquo;
themselves. For the rest, much of the secular history still accepted is
tentatively reduced to myth in the <i lang="de">Geschichte Israels</i>
of Hugo Winckler (1895&ndash;1900). The peculiar theory of Dr. Cheyne
is no less &ldquo;destructive.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="ch21.2.9" class="par">9. In New Testament criticism, though the
strict critical method of Strauss&rsquo;s first book was not faithfully
followed, critical research went on continuously; and the school of F.
C. Baur of T&uuml;bingen in particular imposed a measure of rational
criticism on theologians in general. Apart from Strauss, Baur was
probably the ablest Christian scholar of his day. Always lamed by his
professionalism, he yet toiled endlessly to bring scientific method
into Christian research. His <i lang="de">Paulus, der Apostel Jesu
Christi</i>, 1845; <i lang="de">Kritische Untersuchungen &uuml;ber die
Kanonischen Evangelien</i>, 1847; and <i lang="de">Das Christenthum und
die christliche Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte</i>, 1853, were
epoch-marking works, which recast so radically, in the name of
orthodoxy, the historical conception of Christian origins, that he
figured as the most unsettling critic of his time after Strauss. With
his earlier researches in the history of the first Christian sects and
his history of the Church, they constitute a memorable mass of studious
and original work. In the case of the T&uuml;bingen school as of every
other there was &ldquo;reaction,&rdquo; with the usual pretence by
professional orthodoxy that the innovating criticism had been disposed
of; but no real refutation has ever taken place. Where Baur reduced the
genuine Pauline epistles to four, the last years of the century
witnessed the advent of <span class="sc">Van Manen</span>, who,
following up earlier suggestions, wrought out the thesis that the
epistles are all alike supposititious. This may or may not hold good;
but there has been no restoration of traditionary faith among the mass
of open-minded inquirers. Such work as Zeller&rsquo;s <i>Contents and
Origin of the Acts of the Apostles</i> (1854), produced in Baur&rsquo;s
circle, has substantially <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href=
"#pb435" name="pb435">435</a>]</span>held its ground; and such a
comparatively &ldquo;safe&rdquo; book of the next generation as
Weizs&auml;cker&rsquo;s <i>Apostolic Age</i> (Eng. tr. of 2nd ed. 1893)
leaves no doubt as to the untrustworthiness of the <i>Acts</i>. Thus at
the close of the century the current professional treatises indicated a
&ldquo;Christianity&rdquo; stripped not only of all supernaturalism,
and therefore of the main religious content of the historic creed, but
even of credibility as regards large parts of the non-supernaturalist
narratives of its sacred books. The minute analysis and collocation of
texts which has occupied so much of critical industry has but made
clearer the extreme precariousness of every item in the records. The
amount of credit for historicity that continues to be given to them is
demonstrably unjustifiable on scientific grounds; and the stand for a
&ldquo;Christianity without dogma&rdquo; is more and more clearly seen
to be an economic adjustment, not an outcome of faithful criticism.</p>
<p id="ch21.2.10" class="par">10. The movement of Biblical and other
criticism in Germany has had a significant effect on the supply of
students for the theological profession. The numbers of Protestant and
Catholic theological students in all Germany have varied as
follows:&mdash;<i>Protestant</i>: 1831, 4,147; 1851, 1,631; 1860,
2,520; 1876, 1,539; 1882&ndash;83, 3,168. <i>Catholic</i>: 1831, 1,801;
1840, 866; 1850, 1,393; 1860, 1,209; 1880, 619.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25751src" href="#xd21e25751" name="xd21e25751src">152</a> Thus,
under the reign of reaction which set in after 1848 there was a
prolonged recovery; and again since 1876 the figures rise for
Protestantism through financial stimulus. When, however, we take
population into account, the main movement is clear. In an increasing
proportion, the theological students come from the rural districts
(69&middot;4 in 1861&ndash;70), the towns furnishing ever
fewer;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25757src" href="#xd21e25757" name=
"xd21e25757src">153</a> so that the conservative measures do but
outwardly and formally affect the course of thought; the clergy
themselves showing less and less inclination to make clergymen of their
sons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25762src" href="#xd21e25762" name=
"xd21e25762src">154</a> Even among the Catholic population, though that
has increased from ten millions in 1830 to sixteen millions in 1880,
the number of theological students has fallen from eleven to four per
100,000 inhabitants.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25768src" href=
"#xd21e25768" name="xd21e25768src">155</a> Thus, after many
&ldquo;reactions&rdquo; and much Bismarckism, the <i lang=
"de">Zeit-Geist</i> in Germany was still pronouncedly skeptical in all
classes in 1881,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25776src" href=
"#xd21e25776" name="xd21e25776src">156</a> when the church
accommodation in Berlin provided only two per cent. of the population,

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span>And though there have been yet other alleged
reactions since, and the imperial influence is zealously used for
orthodoxy, a large proportion of the intelligent workers in the towns
remain socialistic and freethinking; and the mass of the educated
classes remain unorthodox in the teeth of the socialist menace.
Reactionary professors can make an academic fashion: the majority of
instructed men remain tacitly naturalistic.</p>
<p class="par">Alongside of the inveterate rationalism of modern
Germany, however, a no less inveterate bureaucratism preserves a
certain official conformity to religion. University freedom does not
extend to open and direct criticism of the orthodox creed. On the other
hand, the applause won by Virchow in 1877 on his declaration against
the doctrine of evolution, and the tactic resorted to by him in putting
upon that doctrine the responsibility of Socialist violence, are
instances of the normal operation of the lower motives against freedom
in scientific teaching.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25794src" href=
"#xd21e25794" name="xd21e25794src">158</a> The pressure operates in
other spheres in Germany, especially under such a regimen as the
present. Men who never go to church save on official occasions, and who
have absolutely no belief in the Church&rsquo;s doctrine, nevertheless
remain nominally its adherents;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25800src"
href="#xd21e25800" name="xd21e25800src">159</a> and the Press laws make
it peculiarly difficult to reach the common people with freethinking
literature, save through Socialist channels. Thus the Catholic Church
is perhaps nowhere&mdash;save in Ireland and the United
States&mdash;more practically influential than in nominally
&ldquo;Protestant&rdquo; Germany, where it wields a compact vote of a
hundred or more in the Reichstag, and can generally count on
well-filled churches as beside the half-empty temples of
Protestantism.</p>
<p class="par">Another circumstance partly favourable to reaction is
the simple maintenance of all the old theological chairs in the
universities. As the field of scientific work widens, and increasing
commerce raises the social standard of comfort, men of original
intellectual power grow less apt to devote themselves to theological
pursuits even under the comparatively free conditions which so long
kept German Biblical scholarship far above that of other countries. It
can hardly be said that men of the mental calibre of Strauss, Baur,
Volkmar, and Wellhausen continue to arise among the specialists in
their studies. Harnack, the most prominent German Biblical scholar of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>our day, despite his great learning, creates no
such impression of originality and insight, and, though latterly forced
forward by more independent minds, exhibits often a very uncritical
orthodoxy. Thus it is &agrave; priori possible enough that the orthodox
reactions so often claimed have actually occurred, in the sense that
the experts have reverted to a prior type. A scientifically-minded
&ldquo;theologian&rdquo; in Germany has now little official scope for
his faculty save in the analysis of the Hebrew Sacred Books and the New
Testament documents as such; and this has been on the whole very well
done, short of the point of express impeachment of the historic
delusion; but there is a limit to the attraction of such studies for
minds of a modern cast. Thus there is always a chance that chairs will
be filled by men of another type.</p>
<p id="ch21.2.11" class="par">11. On a less extensive scale than in
Germany, critical study of the sacred books made some progress in
England, France, and America in the first half of the century; though
for a time the attention even of the educated world was centred much
more upon the Oxford &ldquo;tractarian&rdquo; religious reaction than
upon the movement of rationalism. The reaction, associated mainly with
the name of John Henry Newman, was rather against the political
Erastianism and &aelig;sthetic apathy of the Whig type of Christian
than against German or other criticism, of which Newman knew little.
But against the attitude of those moderate Anglicans who were disposed
to disestablish the Church in Ireland and to modernize the liturgy
somewhat, the language of the &ldquo;Tracts for the Times&rdquo; is as
authoritarian and anti-rationalistic as that of Catholics denouncing
freethought. Such expressions as &ldquo;the filth of heretical
novelty&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25815src" href="#xd21e25815"
name="xd21e25815src">160</a> are meant to apply to anything in the
nature of innovation; the causes at stake are ritual and precedent, the
apostolic succession and the status of the priest, not the truth of
revelation or the credibility of the scriptures. The third Tract
appeals to the clergy to &ldquo;resist the alteration of even one jot
or tittle&rdquo; of the liturgy; and concerning the burial service the
line of argument is: &ldquo;Do you pretend you can discriminate the
wheat from the tares? Of course not.&rdquo; All attempts even to modify
the ritual are an &ldquo;abuse of reason&rdquo;; and the true believer
is adjured to stand fast in the ancient ways.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25823src" href="#xd21e25823" name="xd21e25823src">161</a> At a
pinch he is to &ldquo;consider what <i>Reason</i> says; which surely,
as well as Scripture, was given us for <i>religious</i>
ends&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25834src" href="#xd21e25834"
name="xd21e25834src">162</a> but the only &ldquo;reason&rdquo; thus
recognized is one which accepts the whole apparatus of revelation.
Previous to and alongside of this single-minded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438</a>]</span>reversion to the ideals of the Dark Ages&mdash;a
phenomenon not unconnected with the revival of romanticism by Scott and
Chateaubriand&mdash;there was going on a movement of modernism, of
which one of the overt traces is Milman&rsquo;s <i>History of the
Jews</i> (1829), a work to-day regarded as harmless even by the
orthodox, but sufficient in its time to let Newman see whither
religious &ldquo;Liberalism&rdquo; was heading.</p>
<p class="par">Other and later researches dug much deeper into the
problems of religious historiography. The Unitarian <span class="sc">C.
C. Hennell</span> produced an <i>Inquiry Concerning the Origin of
Christianity</i> (1838), so important for its time as to be thought
worth translating into German by Strauss; and this found a considerable
response from the educated English public of its day. In the preface to
his second edition (1841) Hennell spoke very plainly of &ldquo;the
large and probably increasing amount of unbelief in all classes around
us&rdquo;; and made the then remarkably courageous declarations that in
his experience &ldquo;neither deism, pantheism, nor even atheism
indicates modes of thought incompatible with uprightness and
benevolence&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;the real or affected horror which
it is still a prevailing custom to exhibit towards their names would be
better reserved for those of the selfish, the cruel, the bigot, and
other tormentors of mankind.&rdquo; It was in the circle of Hennell
that <span class="sc">Marian Evans</span>, later to become famous as
<span class="sc">George Eliot</span>, grew into a rationalist in
despite of her religious temperament; and it was she who, when
Hennell&rsquo;s bride gave up the task, undertook the toil of
translating Strauss&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Leben Jesu</i>&mdash;though at
many points she &ldquo;thought him wrong.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e25863src" href="#xd21e25863" name="xd21e25863src">163</a> In the
churches he had of course no overt acceptance. At this stage, English
orthodoxy was of such a cast that the pious Tregelles, himself fiercely
opposed to all forms of rationalism, had to complain that the most
incontrovertible corrections of the current text of the New Testament
were angrily denounced.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25869src" href=
"#xd21e25869" name="xd21e25869src">164</a></p>
<p class="par">In the next generation <span class="sc">Theodore
Parker</span> in the United States, developing his critical faculty
chiefly by study of the Germans, at the cost of much obloquy forced
some knowledge of critical results and a measure of theistic or
pantheistic rationalism on the attention of the orthodox world;
promoting at the same time a semi-philosophic, semi-ethical reaction
against the Calvinistic theology of Jonathan Edwards, theretofore
prevalent among the orthodox of New England. In the old country a
number of writers developed new movements of criticism from theistic
points of view. <span class="sc">F. W. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb439" href="#pb439" name="pb439">439</a>]</span>Newman</span>, the
scholarly brother of John Henry,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25884src"
href="#xd21e25884" name="xd21e25884src">165</a> produced a book
entitled <i>The Soul</i> (1849), and another, <i>Phases of Faith</i>
(1853), which had much influence in promoting rationalism of a rather
rigidly theistic cast. <span class="sc">R. W. Mackay</span> in the same
period published two learned treatises, <i>A Sketch of the Rise and
Progress of Christianity</i> (1854), notably scientific in method for
its time; and <i>The Progress of the Intellect as Exemplified in the
Religious Development of the Greeks and Hebrews</i> (1850), which won
the admiration of Buckle; &ldquo;George Eliot&rdquo; translated
Feuerbach&rsquo;s <i>Essence of Christianity</i> (1854) under her own
name, Marian Evans; and <span class="sc">W. R. Greg</span>, one of the
leading publicists of his day, put forth a rationalist study of <i>The
Creed of Christendom: Its Foundations Contrasted with its
Superstructure</i> (1850), which has gone through many editions and is
still reprinted. In 1864 appeared <i>The Prophet of Nazareth</i>, by
Evan Powell Meredith, who had been a Baptist minister in Wales. The
book is a bulky prize essay on the theme of New Testament eschatology,
which develops into a deistic attack on the central Christian dogma and
on gospel ethics. Another zealous theist, <span class="sc">Thomas
Scott</span>, whose pamphlet-propaganda on deistic lines had so wide an
influence during many years, produced an <i>English Life of Jesus</i>
(1871), which, though less important than the works of Strauss and less
popular than those of Renan, played a considerable part in the
disintegration of the traditional faith among English churchmen. Still
the primacy in critical research on scholarly lines lay with the
Germans; and it was the results of their work that were co-ordinated,
from a theistic standpoint,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25925src" href=
"#xd21e25925" name="xd21e25925src">166</a> in the anonymous work,
<i>Supernatural Religion</i> (1874&ndash;77), a massive and decisive
performance, too powerful to be disposed of by the episcopal and other
attacks made upon it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e25931src" href=
"#xd21e25931" name="xd21e25931src">167</a> Since its assimilation the
orthodox or inspirationist view of the gospels has lost credit among
competent scholars even within the churches. The battleground is now
removed to the problem of the historicity of the ostensible origins of
the cult; and scholarly orthodoxy takes for granted many positions
which fifty years ago were typical of &ldquo;German
rationalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="ch21.2.12" class="par">12. In France systematic criticism of the
sacred books recommenced in the second half of the century with such
writings as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name=

i, 1863); and <span class="sc">Alphonse Peyrat</span> (<i lang=
"fr">Histoire &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire et critique de
J&eacute;sus</i>, 1864); whereafter the rationalistic view was applied
with singular literary charm, if with imperfect consistency, by
<span class="sc">Renan</span> in his series of seven volumes on the
origins of Christianity, and with more scientific breadth of view by
<span class="sc">Ernest Havet</span> in his <i lang="fr">Christianisme
et ses Origines</i> (1872, etc.). Renan&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Vie de
J&eacute;sus</i> (1863) especially has been read throughout the
civilized world. It has been quite justly pronounced, by German and
other critics, a romance; but no other &ldquo;life&rdquo; properly so
called has been anything else, Strauss&rsquo;s first <i>Life</i> being
an analysis rather than a construction; and the epithet was but an
unwitting avowal that to accept the gospels, barring miracles, as
biography&mdash;which is what Renan did&mdash;is to be committed to the
unhistorical. He began by accepting the fourth as equipollent with the
synoptics; and upon this Strauss in his second <i>Life</i> confidently
called for a recantation, which came in due course. But Renan, in his
fitful way, had critical glimpses which were denied to
Strauss&mdash;for instance, as to the material of the Sermon on the
Mount. The whole series of the <i lang="fr">Origines</i>, which wound
up with <i lang="fr">Marc Aur&egrave;le</i> (1882), has a similar
fluctuating value, showing on the whole a progressive critical sense.
The <i>Saint Paul</i>, for example, at the close suddenly discards the
traditional view previously accepted in <i lang="fr">Les
Ap&ocirc;tres</i>, and recognizes that the ministry of Paul can have
been no more than a propaganda of small conventicles, whose total
membership throughout the Empire could not have been above a thousand.
But Renan&rsquo;s total service consisted rather in a highly artistic
and winning application of rational historical methods to early
Christian history, with the effect of displacing the traditionist
method, than in any lasting or comprehensive solution of the problem of
the origins. Havet&rsquo;s survey is both corrective and complementary
to his. Renan&rsquo;s influence on opinion throughout the world,
however, was enormous, were it only because he was one of the most
finished literary artists of his time.</p>

<p id="ch21.3.1" class="par first">1. The whole imaginative literature
of Europe, in the generation after the French Revolution, reveals
directly or indirectly the transmutation that the eighteenth century
had worked in religious thought. Either it reacts against or it
develops the rationalistic movement. In France the literary reaction is
one of the first factors in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441"

and type was Chateaubriand, in whose typical work, the <i lang=

whatever might be the &ldquo;shallowness&rdquo; of Voltairism, it was
profundity beside the philosophy of the majority who repelled it. On
one who now reads it with the slightest scientific preparation, the
book makes an impression in parts of something like fatuity. The
handling of the scientific question at the threshold of the inquiry is
that of a man incapable of a scientific idea. All the accumulating
evidence of geology and pal&aelig;ontology is disposed of by the
grotesque theorem that God made the world out of nothing with all the
marks of antiquity upon it&mdash;the oaks at the start bearing
&ldquo;last year&rsquo;s nests&rdquo;&mdash;on the ground that,
&ldquo;if the world were not at once young and old, the great, the
serious, the moral would disappear from nature, for these sentiments by
their essence attach to antique things.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

religion had caused the Revolution; partly enhanced by the tendency of
every warlike period to develop emotional rather than reflective life.
What was really masterly in Chateaubriand was the style; and
sentimental pietism had now the prestige of fine writing, so long the
specialty of the other side. Yet a generation of monarchism served to
wear out the ill-based credit of the literary reaction; and <i lang=
"fr">belles lettres</i> began to be rationalistic as soon as politics
began again to be radical. Thus the prestige of the neo-Christian
school was already spent before the revolution of 1848;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e26020src" href="#xd21e26020" name=

died in that year, had undone his special influence still earlier. He
had created merely a literary mode and sentiment.</p>
<p id="ch21.3.2" class="par">2. The literary history of France since
his death decides the question, so far as it can be thus decided. From
1848 till our own day it has been predominantly naturalistic and
non-religious. After <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442"
name="pb442">442</a>]</span>Guizot and the Thierrys, the nearest
approach to Christianity by an influential French historian is perhaps
in the case of the very heterodox Edgar Quinet. <span class=
"sc">Michelet</span> was a mere heretic in the eyes of the faithful,
Saisset describing his book <i lang="fr">Du Pr&ecirc;tre, de la Femme,
et de la Famille</i> (1845), as a &ldquo;renaissance of
Voltaireanism.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26036src" href=
"#xd21e26036" name="xd21e26036src">172</a> His whole brilliant History,
indeed, is from beginning to end rationalistic, challenging as it does
all the decorous traditions, exposing the failure of the faith to
civilize, pronouncing that &ldquo;the monastic Middle Age is an age of
idiots&rdquo; and the scholastic world which followed it an age of
artificially formed fools,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26041src" href=

he was popular, withal, not only because of his vividness and unfailing
freshness, but because his convictions were those of the best
intelligence around him. In poetry and fiction the predominance of one
or other shade of freethinking is signal. Balzac, who grew up in the
age of reaction, makes essentially for rationalism by his intense
analysis; and after him the difficulty is to find a great French
novelist who is not frankly rationalistic. George Sand will probably
not be claimed by orthodoxy; and <span class="sc">Beyle</span>,
<span class="sc">Constant</span>, <span class="sc">Flaubert</span>,
<span class="sc">M&eacute;rim&eacute;e</span>, <span class=
"sc">Zola</span>, <span class="sc">Daudet</span>, <span class=
"sc">Maupassant</span>, and the <span class="sc">De Goncourts</span>
make a list against which can be set only the names of M. Bourget, an
artist of the second order, and of the distinguished <i lang=
"fr">d&eacute;cadent</i> Huysmans, who became a Trappist after a life
marked by a philosophy and practice of an extremely different
complexion.</p>
<p id="ch21.3.3" class="par">3. In French poetry the case is hardly
otherwise. <span class="sc">B&eacute;ranger</span>, who passed for a
Voltairean, did indeed claim to have &ldquo;saved from the wreck an

what a critic has called &ldquo;<span lang="fr">la banale
religiosit&eacute; de <i lang="fr">l&rsquo;Espoir en

"#xd21e26112" name="xd21e26112src">176</a> and the pessimist Baudelaire
had not even that to show. De Musset&rsquo;s absurd attack on Voltaire
in his Byronic poem, <i>Rolla</i>, well deserves the same epithets. It
is a mere product of hysteria, representing neither knowledge nor
reflection. The grandiose theism of <span class="sc">Victor
Hugo</span>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>again, is stamped only with his own image and
superscription; and in his great contemporary <span class="sc">Leconte
de Lisle</span> we have one of the most convinced and aggressive
freethinkers of the century, a fine scholar and a self-controlled
pessimist, who felt it well worth his while to write a little
<i>Popular History of Christianity</i> (1871) which would have
delighted d&rsquo;Holbach. It is significant, on the other hand, that
the exquisite religious verse of Verlaine was the product of an
incurable neuropath, like the later work of Huysmans, and stands for
decadence pure and simple. While French <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>
thus in general made for rationalism, criticism was naturally not
behindhand. Sainte-Beuve, the most widely appreciative though not the
most scientific or just of critics, had only a literary sympathy with
the religious types over whom he spent so much effusive
research;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26137src" href="#xd21e26137" name=
"xd21e26137src">177</a> <span class="sc">Edmond Scherer</span> was an
unbeliever almost against his will; <span class="sc">Taine</span>,
though reactionary on political grounds in his latter years, was the
typical French rationalist of his time; and though M.
Bruneti&egrave;re, whose preferences were all for Bossuet, made
&ldquo;the bankruptcy of science&rdquo; the text of his very facile
philosophy, the most scientific and philosophic head in the whole line
of French critics, the late <span class="sc">&Eacute;mile
Hennequin</span>, was wholly a rationalist; and even the rather
reactionary Jules Lema&icirc;tre did not maintain his early attitude of
austerity towards Renan.</p>
<p id="ch21.3.4" class="par">4. In England it was due above all to
Shelley that the very age of reaction was confronted with unbelief in
lyric form. His immature <i>Queen Mab</i> was vital enough with
conviction to serve as an inspiration to a whole host of unlettered
freethinkers not only in its own generation but in the next. Its notes
preserved, and greatly expanded, the tract entitled <i>The Necessity of
Atheism</i>, for which he was expelled from Oxford; and against his
will it became a people&rsquo;s book, the law refusing him copyright in
his own work, on the memorable principle that there could be no
&ldquo;protection&rdquo; for a book setting forth pernicious opinions.
Whether he might not in later life, had he survived, have passed to a
species of mystic Christianity, reacting like Coleridge, but with a
necessary difference, is a question raised by parts of the
<i>Hellas</i>. Gladstone seems to have thought <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name="pb444">444</a>]</span>that
he had in him such a potentiality. But Shelley&rsquo;s work, as done,
sufficed to keep for radicalism and rationalism the crown of song as
against the final Tory orthodoxy<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26177src"
href="#xd21e26177" name="xd21e26177src">178</a> of the elderly
Wordsworth and of Southey; and Coleridge&rsquo;s zeal for (amended)
dogma came upon him after his hour of poetic transfiguration was
past.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">And even Coleridge, who held the heresies of a
modal Trinity and the non-expiatory character of the death of Christ,
was widely distrusted by the pious, and expressed himself privately in
terms which would have outraged them. Miracles, he declared, &ldquo;are
supererogatory. The law of God and the great principles of the
Christian religion would have been the same had Christ never assumed
humanity. It is for these things, and for such as these, for telling
unwelcome truths, that I have been termed an atheist. It is for these
opinions that William Smith assured the Archbishop of Canterbury that I
was (what half the clergy are in <i>their lives</i>) an atheist. Little
do these men know what atheism is. Not one man in a thousand has either
strength of mind or goodness of heart to be an atheist. I repeat it.
Not one man in ten thousand has goodness of heart or strength of mind
to be an atheist.&rdquo; Allsopp&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i>, etc., as
cited, p. 47. But at other times Coleridge was a defender of the faith,
while contemning the methods of the evidential school. <i>Id.</i> pp.

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">On the other side, Scott&rsquo;s honest but
unintellectual romanticism, as we know from Newman, certainly favoured
the Tractarian reaction, to which it was &aelig;sthetically though
hardly emotionally akin. Yet George Eliot could say in later life that
it was the influence of Scott that first unsettled her
orthodoxy;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26205src" href="#xd21e26205"
name="xd21e26205src">179</a> meaning, doubtless, that the prevailing
secularity of his view of life and his objective handling of sects and
faiths excluded even a theistic solution. Scott&rsquo;s orthodoxy was
in fact nearly on all fours with his Jacobitism&mdash;a matter of
temperamental loyalty to a tradition.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26211src" href="#xd21e26211" name="xd21e26211src">180</a> But the
far more potent influence of <span class="sc">Byron</span>, too wayward
to hold a firm philosophy, but too intensely alive to realities to be
capable of Scott&rsquo;s feudal orthodoxy, must have counted much for
heresy even in England, and was one of the literary forces of
revolutionary revival for the whole of Europe. Though he never came to
a clear atheistical decision as did Shelley,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26223src" href="#xd21e26223" name="xd21e26223src">181</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name=

Calvinist, he so handled theological problems in his <i>Cain</i> that
he, like Shelley, was refused copyright in his work;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e26232src" href="#xd21e26232" name="xd21e26232src">182</a> and
it was widely appropriated for freethinkers&rsquo; purposes. The
orthodox Southey was on the same grounds denied the right to suppress
his early revolutionary drama, <i>Wat Tyler</i>, which accordingly was
made to do duty in Radical propaganda by freethinking publishers.
Keats, again, though he melodiously declaimed, in a boyish mood,
against the scientific analysis of the rainbow, and though he never
assented to Shelley&rsquo;s impeachments of Christianity, was in no
active sense a believer in it, and after his long sickness met death
gladly without the &ldquo;consolations&rdquo; ascribed to
creed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26244src" href="#xd21e26244" name=

<p id="ch21.3.5" class="par">5. One of the best-beloved names in
English literature, Charles Lamb, is on several counts to be numbered
with those of the freethinkers of his day&mdash;who included Godwin and
Hazlitt&mdash;though he had no part in any direct propaganda. Himself
at most a Unitarian, but not at all given to argument on points of
faith, he did his work for reason partly by way of the subtle and
winning humanism of such an essay as <i>New Year&rsquo;s Eve</i>, which
seems to have been what brought upon him the pedantically pious censure
of Southey, apparently for its lack of allusion to a future state;
partly by his delicately-entitled letter, <i>The Tombs in the
Abbey</i>, in which he replied to Southey&rsquo;s stricture. &ldquo;A
book which wants only a sounder religious feeling to be as delightful
as it is original&rdquo; had been Southey&rsquo;s pompous criticism, in
a paper on <i>Infidelity</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26261src"
href="#xd21e26261" name="xd21e26261src">184</a> In his reply, Lamb
commented on Southey&rsquo;s life-long habit of scoffing at the Church
of Rome, and gravely repudiated the test of orthodoxy for human
character.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Lamb&rsquo;s words are not generally known, and
are worth remembering. &ldquo;I own,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I never
could think so considerably of myself as to decline the society of an
agreeable or worthy man upon difference of opinion only. The
impediments and the facilitations to a sound belief are various and
inscrutable as the heart of man. Some believe upon weak principles;
others cannot feel the efficacy of the strongest. One of the most
candid, most upright, and single-meaning men I ever knew was the late
Thomas Holcroft. I believe he never said one thing and meant another in
his life; and, as near as I can guess, he never acted otherwise than
with the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name=
"pb446">446</a>]</span>scrupulous attention to conscience. Ought we to
wish the character false for the sake of a hollow compliment to
Christianity?&rdquo; Of the freethinking and unpopular Hazlitt, who had
soured towards Lamb in his perverse way, the essayist spoke still more
generously. Of Leigh Hunt he speaks more critically, but with the same
resolution to stand by a man known as a heretic. But the severest flout
to Southey and his Church is in the next paragraph, where, after the
avowal that &ldquo;the last sect with which you can remember me to have
made common profession were the Unitarians,&rdquo; he tells how, on the
previous Easter Sunday, he had attended the service in Westminster
Abbey, and when he would have lingered afterwards among the tombs to
meditate, was &ldquo;turned, like a dog or some profane person, out
into the common street, with feelings which I could not help, but not
very congenial to the day or the discourse. I do not know,&rdquo; he
adds, &ldquo;that I shall ever venture myself again into one of your
churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">These words were published in the <i>London Magazine</i>
in 1825; but in the posthumous collected edition of the <i>Essays of
Elia</i> all the portions above cited were dropped, and the paragraph
last quoted from was modified, leaving out the last words. The essay
does not seem to have been reprinted in full till it appeared in R. H.
Shepherd&rsquo;s edition of 1878. But the original issue in the
<i>London Magazine</i> created a tradition among the lovers of Lamb,
and his name has always been associated with some repute for
freethinking. There is further very important testimony as to
Lamb&rsquo;s opinions in one of Allsopp&rsquo;s records of the
conversation of Coleridge:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, no; Lamb&rsquo;s skepticism has not come
lightly, nor is he a skeptic [<i>sic</i>: Query, <i>scoffer</i>?]. The
harsh reproof to Godwin for his contemptuous allusion to Christ before
a well-trained child proves that he is not a skeptic [? scoffer]. His
mind, never prone to analysis, seems to have been disgusted with the
hollow pretences, the false reasonings and absurdities of the rogues
and fools with whom all establishments, and all creeds seeking to
become established, abound. I look upon Lamb as one hovering between
earth and heaven; neither hoping much nor fearing anything. It is
curious that he should retain many usages which he learnt or adopted in
the fervour of his early religious feelings, now that his faith is in a
state of suspended animation. Believe me, who know him well, that Lamb,
say what he will, has more of the <i>essentials</i> of Christianity
than ninety-nine out of a hundred professing Christians. He has all
that would still have been Christian had Christ never lived or been
made manifest upon earth.&rdquo; (Allsopp&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i>, etc.,
as cited, p. 46.) In connection with the frequently cited anecdote as
to Lamb&rsquo;s religious feeling given in Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s
<i>Autobiography</i> (rep. p. 253), also by Hazlitt (<i>Winterslow</i>,
essay ii, ed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name=
"pb447">447</a>]</span>1902, p. 39), may be noted the following, given
by Allsopp: &ldquo;After a visit to Coleridge, during which the
conversation had taken a religious turn, Leigh Hunt ... expressed his
surprise that such a man as Coleridge should, when speaking of Christ,
always call him Our Saviour. Lamb, who had been exhilarated by one
glass of that gooseberry or raisin cordial which he has so often
anathematized, stammered out: &lsquo;Ne-ne-never mind what Coleridge
says; he is full of fun.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p id="ch21.3.6" class="par">6. While a semi-Bohemian like Lamb could
thus dare to challenge the reigning bigotry, the graver English writers
of the first half of the century who had abandoned or never accepted
orthodoxy felt themselves for the most part compelled to silence or
ostensible compliance. It was made clear by Carlyle&rsquo;s posthumous
<i>Reminiscences</i> that he had early turned away from Christian
dogma, having in fact given up a clerical career because of unbelief.
Later evidence abounds. At the age of fifteen, by his own account, he
had horrified his mother with the question: &ldquo;Did God Almighty
come down and make wheel-barrows in a shop?&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e26312src" href="#xd21e26312" name="xd21e26312src">185</a> Of
his college life he told: &ldquo;I studied the evidences of
Christianity for several years, with the greatest desire to be
convinced, but in vain. I read Gibbon, and then first clearly saw that
Christianity was not true. Then came the most trying time of my
life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26317src" href="#xd21e26317"
name="xd21e26317src">186</a> Goethe, he claimed, led him to peace; but
philosophic peace he never attained. &ldquo;He was contemptuous to
those who held to Christian dogmas; he was angry with those who gave
them up; he was furious with those who attacked them. If equanimity be
the mark of a Philosopher, he was of all great-minded men the least of
a Philosopher.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26322src" href=
"#xd21e26322" name="xd21e26322src">187</a> To all freethinking work,
scholarly or other, he was hostile with the hostility of a man
consciously in a false position. Strauss&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Leben
Jesu</i> he pronounced, quite late in life, &ldquo;a revolutionary and
ill-advised enterprise, setting forth in words what all wise men had in
their minds for fifty years past, and thought it fittest to hold their
peace about.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26329src" href=
"#xd21e26329" name="xd21e26329src">188</a> He was, in fact, so false to

"xd21e26334src">189</a> Even Mill did so only partially in his
lifetime, as in his address to the St. Andrews students (1867), when,
&ldquo;in the reception given to the Address, he was most struck by the
vociferous applause of the divinity students at the freethought
passage.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26343src" href="#xd21e26343"
name="xd21e26343src">190</a> In the first half of the century such
displays of courage were rare indeed. Only <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name=

avowed, by the publication of a deistic prayer found among his papers,
that he had had no belief in revelation.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">Despite his anxious caution, Carlyle&rsquo;s writing
conveyed to susceptible readers a non-Christian view of things. We know
from a posthumous writing of Mr. Froude&rsquo;s that, when that writer
had gone through the university and taken holy orders without ever
having had a single doubt as to his creed, Carlyle&rsquo;s books
&ldquo;taught him that the religion in which he had been reared was but
one of many dresses in which spiritual truth had arrayed itself, and
that the creed was not literally true so far as it was a narrative of
facts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26359src" href="#xd21e26359"
name="xd21e26359src">192</a> It was presumably from the <i>Sartor
Resartus</i> and some of the Essays, such as that on
Voltaire&mdash;perhaps, also, negatively from the general absence of
Christian sentiment in Carlyle&rsquo;s works&mdash;that such lessons
were learned; and though it is certain that many non-zealous Christians
saw no harm in Carlyle, there is reason to believe that for multitudes
of readers he had the same awakening virtue. It need hardly be said
that his friend Emerson exercised it in no less degree. Mr. Froude was
remarkable in his youth for his surrender of the clerical profession,
in the teeth of a bitter opposition from his family, and further for
his publication of a freethinking romance, <i>The Nemesis of Faith</i>
(1849); but he went far to conciliate Anglican orthodoxy by his
<i>History</i>. The romance had a temporary vogue rather above its
artistic merits as a result of being publicly burned by the authorities
of Exeter College, Oxford, of which he was a Fellow.<a class="noteref"

<p id="ch21.3.7" class="par">7. This attitude of orthodoxy, threatening
ostracism to any avowed freethinker who had a position to lose, must be
kept in mind in estimating the English evolution of that time. A
professed man of science could write in 1838 that &ldquo;the new mode
of interpreting the Scriptures which has sprung up in Germany is the
darkest cloud which lowers upon the horizon of that country.... The
Germans have been conducted by some of their teachers to the borders of
a precipice, one leap from which will plunge them into deism.&rdquo; He
added that in various parts of Europe &ldquo;the heaviest calamity
impending over the whole fabric of society in our time is the
lengthening stride of bold skepticism in some parts, and the more
stealthy onwards-creeping <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href=

others.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26382src" href="#xd21e26382"
name="xd21e26382src">194</a> Such declamation could terrorize the timid
and constrain the prudent in such a society as that of early Victorian
England. The prevailing note is struck in Macaulay&rsquo;s description
of Charles Blount as &ldquo;an infidel, and the head of a small school
of infidels who were troubled with a morbid desire to make
converts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26387src" href=

cleared his conscience by thus denouncing those who had the courage of
their opinions. In this simple fashion some of the sanest writers in
history were complacently put below the level of the commonplace
dissemblers who aspersed them; and the average educated man saw no
baseness in the procedure.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The opinion deliberately expressed in this
connection by the late Professor Bain is worth noting:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It can at last be clearly seen what was the
motive of Carlyle&rsquo;s perplexing style of composition. We now know
what his opinions were when he began to write, and that to express them
would have been fatal to his success; yet he was not a man to indulge
in rank hypocrisy. He accordingly adopted a studied and ambiguous
phraseology, which for long imposed upon the religious public, who put
their own interpretation upon his mystical utterances, and gave him the
benefit of any doubt. In the <i>Life of Sterling</i> he threw off the
mask, but still was not taken at his word. Had there been a perfect
tolerance of all opinions, he would have begun as he ended; and his
strain of composition, while still mystical and high-flown, would never
have been identified with our national orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have grave doubts as to whether we possess
Macaulay&rsquo;s real opinions on religion. His way of dealing with the
subject is so like the hedging of an unbeliever that, without some good
assurance to the contrary, I must include him also among the imitators
of Aristotle&rsquo;s &lsquo;caution.&rsquo;...</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When Sir Charles Lyell brought out his
<i>Antiquity of Man</i>, he too was cautious. Knowing the dangers of
his footing, he abstained from giving an estimate of the extension of
time required by the evidences of human remains. Society in London,
however, would not put up with this reticence, and he had to disclose
at dinner parties what he had withheld from the public&mdash;namely,
that in his opinion the duration of man could not be less than 50,000
years&rdquo; (<i>Practical Essays</i>, p. 274.)</p>

reaction and conservatism, even apart from the positive criticism of
creed which from time to time forced its head up, there is a visible
play of a new spirit in the most notable of the serious writing of the
time. Carlyle undermined orthodoxy even in his asseveration of
unreasoned theism; Emerson disturbs it alike when he acclaims mystics
and welcomes evolutionary science; and the whole inspiration of
Mill&rsquo;s <i>Logic</i> no less than of his <i>Liberty</i> is
something alien to the principle of authority. Of Ruskin, again, the
same may be asserted in respect of his many searching thrusts at
clerical and lay practice, his defence of Colenso, and the obvious
disappearance from his later books of the evangelical orthodoxy of the
earlier.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26445src" href="#xd21e26445" name=
"xd21e26445src">198</a> Thus the most celebrated writers of serious
English prose in the latter half of the century were in a measure
associated with the spirit of critical thought on matters religious. In
a much stronger degree the same thing may be predicated finally of the
writer who in the field of English <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>,
apart from fiction, came nearest them in fame and influence. Matthew
Arnold, passing insensibly from the English attitude of academic
orthodoxy to that of the humanist for whom Christ is but an admirable
teacher and God a &ldquo;Something not ourselves which makes for
righteousness,&rdquo; became for the England of his later years the
favourite pilot across the bar between supernaturalism and naturalism.
Only in England, perhaps, could his curious gospel of church-going and
Bible-reading atheism have prospered, but there it prospered
exceedingly. Alike as poet and as essayist, even when essaying to
disparage Colenso or to confute the Germans where they jostled his
predilection for the Fourth Gospel, he was a disintegrator of
tradition, and, in his dogmatic way, a dissolver of dogmatism. When,
therefore, beside the four names just mentioned the British public
placed those of the philosophers Spencer, Lewes, and Mill, and the
scientists Darwin, Huxley, Clifford, and Tyndall, they could not but
recognize that the mind of the age was divorced from the nominal faith
of the Church. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=

<p id="ch21.3.9" class="par">9. In English fiction, the beginning of
the end of genuine faith was apparent to the prophetic eyes of
Wilberforce and Robert Hall, of whom the former lamented the total
absence of Christian sentiment from nearly all the successful fiction
even of his day;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26459src" href=
"#xd21e26459" name="xd21e26459src">199</a> and the latter avowed the
pain with which he noted that Miss Edgeworth, whom he admired for her
style and art, put absolutely no religion in her books,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e26464src" href="#xd21e26464" name=
"xd21e26464src">200</a> while Hannah More, whose principles were so
excellent, had such a vicious style. With Thackeray and Dickens,
indeed, serious fiction might seem to be on the side of faith, both
being liberally orthodox, though neither ventured on religious romance;
but with <span class="sc">George Eliot</span> the balance began to lean
the other way, her sympathetic treatment of religious types counting
for little as against her known rationalism. At the end of the century
almost all of the leading writers of the higher fiction were known to
be either rationalists or simple theists; and against the heavy metal
of Mr. Meredith, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Hardy, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Moore (whose
sympathetic handling of religious motives suggests the influence of
Huysmans), and the didactic-deistic Mrs. Humphry-Ward, orthodoxy can
but claim artists of the third or lower grades. The championship of
some of the latter may be regarded as the last humiliation of
faith.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">In 1905 there was current a vulgar novel entitled
<i>When it was Dark</i>, wherein was said to be drawn a blood-curdling
picture of what would happen in the event of a general surrender of
Christian faith. Despite some episcopal approbation, the book excited
much disgust among the more enlightened clergy. The preface to Miss
Marie Corelli&rsquo;s <i>Mighty Atom</i> may serve to convey to the
many readers who cannot peruse the works of that lady an idea of the
temper in which she vindicates her faith. Another popular novelist of a
low artistic grade, the late Mr. Seton-Merriman, has avowed his
religious soundness in a romance with a Russian plot, entitled <i>The
Sowers</i>. Referring to the impressions produced by great scenes of
Nature, he writes: &ldquo;These places and these times are good for
convalescent atheists and such as pose as unbelievers&mdash;the
cheapest form of notoriety&rdquo; (p. 168). The novelist&rsquo;s own
Christian ethic is thus indicated: &ldquo;He had Jewish blood in his
veins, which ... carried with it the usual tendency to cringe. It is in
the blood; it is part of that which the people who stood without
Pilate&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name=
"pb452">452</a>]</span>palace took upon themselves and their
children&rdquo; (p. 59). But the enormous mass of modern novels
includes some tolerable pleas for faith, as well as many manifestoes of
agnosticism. One of the works of the late &ldquo;Edna Lyall,&rdquo;
<i>We Two</i>, was notable as the expression of the sympathy of a
devout, generous, and amiable Christian lady with the personality and
career of Mr. Bradlaugh.</p>

<p id="ch21.3.10" class="par">10. Among the most artistically gifted of
the English story-writers and essayists of the last generation of the
century was <span class="sc">Richard Jefferies</span> (d. 1887), who in
<i>The Story of My Heart</i> (1883) has told how &ldquo;the last traces
and relics of superstitions acquired compulsorily in childhood&rdquo;
finally passed away from his mind, leaving him a Naturalist in every
sense of the word. In the <i>Eulogy of Richard Jefferies</i> published
by Sir Walter Besant in 1888 it is asserted that on his deathbed
Jefferies returned to his faith, and &ldquo;died listening with faith
and love to the words contained in the Old Book.&rdquo; A popular
account of this &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; accordingly became current,
and was employed to the usual purpose. As has been shown by a careful
student, and as was admitted on inquiry by Sir Walter Besant, there had
been no conversion whatever, Jefferies having simply listened to his
wife&rsquo;s reading without hinting at any change in his
convictions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26502src" href="#xd21e26502"
name="xd21e26502src">201</a> Despite his biographer&rsquo;s express
admission of his error, Christian journals, such as the
<i>Spectator</i>, have burked the facts; one, the <i>Christian</i>, has
piously charged dishonesty on the writer who brought them to light; and
a third, the Salvationist <i>War Cry</i>, has pronounced his action
&ldquo;the basest form of chicanery and falsehood.&rdquo;<a class=

<p id="ch21.3.11" class="par">11. Though Shelley was anathema to
English Christians in his own clay, his fame and standing steadily rose
in the generations after his death. Nor has the balance of English
poetry ever reverted to the side of faith. Even Tennyson, who more than
once struck at rationalism below the belt, is in his own despite the
poet of doubt as much as of credence, however he might wilfully attune
himself to the key of faith; and the unparalleled optimism of Browning
evolved a form of Christianity sufficiently alien to the historic
creed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26526src" href="#xd21e26526" name=
"xd21e26526src">203</a> In <span class="sc">Clough</span> and

record of surrendered faith. Alongside of Arnold, <span class=

temper that Leconte de Lisle reserved for prose; and the ill-starred
but finely gifted <span class="sc">James Thomson</span>
(&ldquo;B.V.&rdquo;) was no less definitely though despairingly an
unbeliever. Among our later poets, finally, the balance is pretty much
the same. Mr. Watson has declared in worthily noble diction for a high
agnosticism, and the late John Davidson defied orthodox ethics in the
name of his very antinomian theology;<a class="noteref" id=

the late Francis Thompson; the declamatory orthodoxy of Mr. Noyes; and

<p id="ch21.3.12" class="par">12. Of the imaginative literature of the
United States, as of that of England, the same generalization broadly
holds good. The incomparable Hawthorne, whatever his psychological
sympathy with the Puritan past, wrought inevitably by his art for the
loosening of its intellectual hold; <span class="sc">Poe</span>, though
he did not venture till his days of downfall to write his

Higginson</span>, have been avowedly on the side of rationalism, or, as
the term goes in the States, &ldquo;liberalism.&rdquo; Though the tone
of ordinary conversation is more often reminiscent of religion in the
United States than in England, the novel and the newspaper have been
perhaps more thoroughly secularized there than here; and in the public
honour <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name=

Dr. Moncure Conway at the hands of his <i>alma mater</i>, the Dickinson
College, West Virginia, may be seen the proof that the official

birth.</p>
<p id="ch21.3.13" class="par">13. Of the vast modern output of <i lang=
"fr">belles lettres</i> in continental Europe, finally, a similar
account is to be given. The supreme poet of modern Italy, <span class=
"sc">Leopardi</span>, is one of the most definitely rationalistic as
well as one of the greatest philosophic poets in literature;
<span class="sc">Carducci</span>, the greatest of his successors, was
explicitly anti-Christian; and despite all the claims of the Catholic
socialists, there is little modern Catholic literature in Italy of any
European value. One of the most distinguished of modern Italian
scholars, Professor A. de <span class="sc">Gubernatis</span>, has in
his <i lang="it">Letture sopra la mitologia vedica</i> (1874)
explicitly treated the Christian legend as a myth. In Germany we have
seen Goethe and Schiller distinctly counting for naturalism; and of
Jean Paul Richter (1763&ndash;1825) an orthodox historian declares that
his &ldquo;religion was a chaotic fermenting of the mind, out of which
now deism, then Christianity, then a new religion, seems to come
forth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26622src" href="#xd21e26622"
name="xd21e26622src">207</a> The naturalistic line is found to be
continued in <span class="sc">Heinrich von Kleist</span>, the unhappy
but masterly dramatist of <i lang="de">Der Zerbrochene Krug</i>, one of
the truest geniuses of his time; and above all in <span class=
"sc">Heine</span>, whose characteristic profession of reconciling
himself on his deathbed with the deity he imaged as &ldquo;the
Aristophanes of heaven&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26637src"
href="#xd21e26637" name="xd21e26637src">208</a> serves so scantily to
console the orthodox lovers of his matchless song. His criticism of
Kant and Fichte is a sufficient clue to his serious convictions; and
that &ldquo;God is all that there is&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26645src" href="#xd21e26645" name="xd21e26645src">209</a> is the
sufficient expression of his pantheism. The whole purport of his
brilliant sketch of the <i>History of Religion and Philosophy in
Germany</i> (1834; 2nd ed. 1852) is a propaganda of the very spirit of
freethinking, which constitutes for Germany at once a literary classic
and a manifesto of rationalism. As he himself said of the return of the
aged Schelling to Catholicism, we may say of Heine, that a deathbed
reversion to early beliefs is a pathological phenomenon.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The use latterly made of Heine&rsquo;s deathbed
re-conversion by orthodoxy in England is characteristic. The late
letters and conversations in which he said edifying things of God and
the Bible are cited for readers who know nothing of the context, and
almost as little of the speaker. He had similarly praised the Bible in
1830 (Letter of July, in B. iii of his volume on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name=
"pb455">455</a>]</span>B&ouml;rne&mdash;<i lang="de">Werke</i>, vii,
160). To the reader of the whole it is clear that, while Heine&rsquo;s
verbal renunciation of his former pantheism, and his characterization
of the pantheistic position as a &ldquo;timid atheism,&rdquo; might
have been made independently of his physical prostration, his
profession of the theism at which he had formerly scoffed is only
momentarily serious, even at a time when such a reversion would have
been in no way surprising. His return to and praise of the Bible, the
book of his childhood, during years of extreme suffering and utter
helplessness, was in the ordinary way of physiological reaction. But
inasmuch as his thinking faculty was never extinguished by his
tortures, he chronically indicated that his religious talk was a
half-conscious indulgence of the overstrained emotional nature, and
substantially an exercise of his poetic feeling&mdash;always as large a
part of his psychosis as his reasoning faculty. Even in deathbed
profession he was neither a Jew nor a Christian, his language being
that of a deism &ldquo;scarcely distinguishable in any essential
element from that of Voltaire or Diderot&rdquo; (Strodtmann, <i lang=
"de">Heine&rsquo;s Leben und Werke</i>, 2te Aufl. ii, 386). &ldquo;My
religious convictions and views,&rdquo; he writes in the preface to the
late <i>Romancero</i>, &ldquo;remain free of all churchism.... I have
abjured nothing, not even my old heathen Gods, from whom I have parted
in love and friendship.&rdquo; In his will he peremptorily forbade any
clerical procedure at his funeral; and his feeling on that side is
revealed in his sad jests to his friend Meissner in 1850. &ldquo;If I
could only go out on crutches!&rdquo; he exclaimed; adding: &ldquo;Do
you know where I should go? Straight to church.&rdquo; On his friends
expressing disbelief, he went on: &ldquo;Certainly, to church! Where
should a man go on crutches? Naturally, if I could walk without
crutches, I should go to the laughing boulevards or the Jardin
Mabille.&rdquo; The story is told in England <i>without</i> the
conclusion, as a piece of &ldquo;Christian Evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But even as to his theism Heine was never more than
wilfully and poetically a believer. In 1849 we find him jesting about
&ldquo;God&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Gods,&rdquo; declaring he will not
offend the <i lang="de">lieber Gott</i>, whose vultures he knows and
respects. &ldquo;Opium is also a religion,&rdquo; he writes in 1850.
&ldquo;Christianity is useless for the healthy ... for the sick it is a
very good religion.&rdquo; &ldquo;If the German people in their need
accept the King of Prussia, why should not I accept the personal
God?&rdquo; And in speaking of the postscript to the <i>Romancero</i>
he writes in 1851: &ldquo;Alas, I had neither time nor mood to say
there what I wanted&mdash;namely, that I die as a Poet, who needs
neither religion nor philosophy, and has nothing to do with either. The
Poet understands very well the symbolic idiom of Religion, and the
abstract jargon of Philosophy; but neither the religious gentry nor
those of philosophy will ever understand the Poet.&rdquo; A few weeks
before his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href="#pb456" name=
"pb456">456</a>]</span>death he signs a New Year letter,
&ldquo;Nebuchadnezzar II, formerly Prussian Atheist, now
Lotosflower-adorer.&rdquo; At this time he was taking immense doses of
morphia to make his tortures bearable. A few hours before his death a
querying pietist got from him the answer: &ldquo;God will pardon me; it
is his business.&rdquo; The <i lang="de">Gest&auml;ndnisse</i>, written
in 1854, ends in absolute irony; and his alleged grounds for giving up
atheism, sometimes quoted seriously, are purely humorous (<i lang=
"de">Werke</i>, iv, 33). If it be in any sense true, as he tells in the
preface to the <i>Romancero</i>, that &ldquo;the high clerisy of
atheism pronounced its anathema&rdquo; over him&mdash;that is to say,
that former friends denounced him as a weak turncoat&mdash;it needed
only the publication of his Life and Letters to enable freethinkers to
take an entirely sympathetic view of his case, which may serve as a
supreme example of &ldquo;the martyrdom of man.&rdquo; On the whole
question see Strodtmann, as cited, ii, 372 <i>sq.</i>, and the <i lang=
"de">Gest&auml;ndnisse</i>, which should be compared with the earlier
written fragments of <i lang="de">Briefe &uuml;ber Deutschland</i>
(<i lang="de">Werke</i>, iii, 110), where there are some significant
variations in statements of fact.</p>

<p id="ch21.3.14" class="par">14. But perhaps the most considerable
evidence, in <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>, of the predominance of
rationalism in modern Europe is to be found in the literary history of
the Scandinavian States and Russia. The Russian development indeed had
gone far ere the modern Scandinavian literatures had well begun.
Already in the first quarter of the century the poet Poushkine was an
avowed heretic; and Gogol even let his art suffer from his
preoccupations with the new humanitarian ideas; while the critic
<span class="sc">Bi&eacute;linsky</span>, classed by Tourgu&eacute;nief
as the Lessing of Russia,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26735src" href=

rationalistic,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26741src" href="#xd21e26741"
name="xd21e26741src">212</a> as was his contemporary the critic
<span class="sc">Granovsky</span>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26751src"
href="#xd21e26751" name="xd21e26751src">213</a> reputed the finest
Russian stylist of his day. At this period <i lang="fr">belles

Russia,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26760src" href="#xd21e26760" name=
"xd21e26760src">214</a> and all educated thought was moulded by it. The
most perfect artistic result is the fiction of the freethinker
<span class="sc">Tourgu&eacute;nief</span>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26766src" href="#xd21e26766" name="xd21e26766src">215</a> the
Sophocles <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb457" href="#pb457" name=
"pb457">457</a>]</span>of the modern novel. His two great
contemporaries, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, count indeed for
supernaturalism; but the truly wonderful genius of the former was
something apart from his philosophy, which was merely childlike; and
the latter, the least masterly if the most strenuous artist of the
three, made his religious converts in Russia chiefly among the
uneducated, and was in any case sharply antagonistic to orthodox
Christianity. It does not appear that the younger writer, Potapenko, a
fine artist, is orthodox, despite his extremely sympathetic presentment
of a superior priest; and the still younger Gorky is an absolute
Naturalist.</p>
<p id="ch21.3.15" class="par">15. In the Scandinavian States, again,
there are hardly any exceptions to the freethinking tendency among the
leading living men of letters. In the person of the abnormal
religionist S&ouml;ren Kierkegaard (1813&ndash;1855) a new force of
criticism began to stir in Denmark. Setting out as a theologian,
Kierkegaard gradually developed, always on quasi-religious lines, into
a vehement assailant of conventional Christianity, somewhat in the
spirit of Pascal, somewhat in that of Feuerbach, again in that of
Ruskin; and in a temper recalling now a Berserker and now a Hebrew
prophet. The general effect of his teaching may be gathered from the
mass of the work of <span class="sc">Henrik Ibsen</span>, who was his
disciple, and in particular from Ibsen&rsquo;s <i>Brand</i>, of which
the hero is partly modelled on Kierkegaard.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26782src" href="#xd21e26782" name="xd21e26782src">216</a> Ibsen,

and tradition had preserved among the majority of educated men, to the
end of the eighteenth century, a notion of deity either slightly
removed from that of the ancient Hebrews or ethically purified without
being philosophically transformed, though the astronomy of Copernicus,
Galileo, and Newton had immensely modified the Hebraic conception of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=

not really hold by the Christian scheme&mdash;he wrote, at times, in
fact, as a pantheist&mdash;but some later astronomers seem to have done
so. When, however, the great <span class="sc">Laplace</span> developed
the nebular hypothesis, previously guessed at by Bruno and outlined by
Kant, orthodox psychological habit was rudely shaken as regards the
Biblical account of creation; and like every other previous advance in
physical science this was denounced as atheistic<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26816src" href="#xd21e26816" name=
"xd21e26816src">217</a>&mdash;which, as we know, it was, Laplace having
declared in reply to Napoleon that he had no need of the God
hypothesis. Confirmed in essentials by all subsequent science,
Laplace&rsquo;s system widens immensely the gulf between modern
cosmology and the historic theism of the Christian era; and the
subsequent concrete developments of astronomy, giving as they do such
an insistent and overwhelming impression of physical infinity, have
made the &ldquo;Christian hypothesis&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26822src" href="#xd21e26822" name="xd21e26822src">218</a>
fantastic save for minds capable of enduring any strain on the sense of
consistency. Paine had brought the difficulty vividly home to the
common intelligence; and though the history of orthodoxy is a history
of the success of institutions and majorities in imposing incongruous
conformities, the perception of the incongruity on this side must have
been a force of disintegration. The freethinking of the French
astronomers of the Revolution period marks a decisive change; and as
early as 1826 we find in a work on Jewish antiquities by a Scotch
clergyman a very plain indication<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26828src"
href="#xd21e26828" name="xd21e26828src">219</a> of disbelief in the
Hebrew story of the stopping of the sun and moon, or (alternatively) of
the rotation of the earth. It is typical of the tenacity of religious
delusion that a quarter of a century later this among other irrational
credences was contended for by the Swiss theologian Gaussen,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e26834src" href="#xd21e26834" name=

for all scientifically trained men they had become untenable. And that
the general growth of scientific thought was disintegrating among
scientific men the old belief in miracles may be gathered from an
article, remarkable in its day, which appeared in the <i>Edinburgh

the thesis of Hume that miracles cannot be proved by any testimony.</p>
<p class="par">Leslie&rsquo;s own case is one of the milestones marking
the slow recovery of progress in Britain after the Revolution. His
appointment to the chair of Mathematics, after Playfair, at Edinburgh
University in 1805 was bitterly resisted by the orthodox on the score
that he was a disbeliever in miracles and an &ldquo;infidel&rdquo; of
the school of Hume, who had been his personal friend. Nevertheless he
again succeeded Playfair in the chair of Physics in 1819, and was
knighted in 1832. The invention of the hygrometer and the discovery of
the relations of light and heat had begun to count for more in science
than the profession of orthodoxy.</p>
<p id="ch21.4.2" class="par">2. From France came likewise the impulse
to a naturalistic handling of biology, long before the day of Darwin.
The protagonist in this case was the physician <span class=
"sc">P.-J.-G. Cabanis</span> (1737&ndash;1808), the colleague of
Laplace in the School of Sciences. Growing up in the generation of the
Revolution, Cabanis had met, in the salon of Madame Helv&eacute;tius,
d&rsquo;Holbach, Diderot, D&rsquo;Alembert, Condorcet, Laplace,
Condillac, Volney, Franklin, and Jefferson, and became the physician of
Mirabeau. His treatise on the <i lang="fr">Rapports du physique et du
morale de l&rsquo;homme</i> (1796&ndash;1802)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26863src" href="#xd21e26863" name="xd21e26863src">222</a> might
be described as the systematic application to psychology of that
&ldquo;positive&rdquo; method to which all the keenest thought of the
eighteenth century had been tending, yet with much of the literary or
rhetorical tone by which the French writers of that age had nearly all
been characterized. For Cabanis, the psychology of Helv&eacute;tius and
Condillac had been hampered by their ignorance of physiology;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e26866src" href="#xd21e26866" name=
"xd21e26866src">223</a> and he easily put aside the primary errors,
such as the &ldquo;equality of minds&rdquo; and the entity of
&ldquo;the soul,&rdquo; which they took over from previous thinkers.
His own work is on the whole the most searching and original handling
of the main problems of psycho-physiology that had yet been achieved;
and to this day its suggestiveness has not been exhausted.</p>
<p class="par">But Cabanis, in his turn, made the mistake of
Helv&eacute;tius and Condillac. Not content with presenting the results
of his study in the province in which he was relatively master, he
undertook to reach ultimate truth in those of ethics and philosophy, in
which he was not so. In the preface to the <i lang="fr">Rapports</i> he
lays down an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460" name=
"pb460">460</a>]</span>emphatically agnostic conviction as to final
causes: &ldquo;ignorance the most invincible,&rdquo; he declares, is
all that is possible to man on that issue.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26880src" href="#xd21e26880" name="xd21e26880src">224</a> But not
only does he in his main work freely and loosely generalize on the
phenomena of history and overleap the ethical problem: he penned
shortly before his death a <i lang="fr">Lettre sur les causes
premi&egrave;res</i>, addressed to Fauriel,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26889src" href="#xd21e26889" name="xd21e26889src">225</a> in
which the aging intelligence is seen reverting to &agrave; priori
processes, and concluding in favour of a &ldquo;sort of stoic
pantheism&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26893src" href=
"#xd21e26893" name="xd21e26893src">226</a> with a balance towards
normal theism and a belief in immortality. The final doctrine did not
in the least affect the argument of the earlier, which was simply one
of positive science; but the clerical world, which had in the usual
fashion denounced the scientific doctrine, not on the score of any
attack by Cabanis upon religion, but because of its incompatibility
with the notion of the soul, naturally made much of the
mystical,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26896src" href="#xd21e26896" name=
"xd21e26896src">227</a> and accorded its framer authority from that
moment.</p>
<p class="par">As for the conception of &ldquo;vitalism&rdquo; put
forward in the Letter to Fauriel by way of explanation of the phenomena
of life, it is but a reversion to the earlier doctrine of Stahl, of
which Cabanis had been a partisan in his youth.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26901src" href="#xd21e26901" name="xd21e26901src">228</a> The
fact remains that he gave an enduring impulse to positive
science,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26907src" href="#xd21e26907" name=
"xd21e26907src">229</a> his own final vacillation failing to arrest the
employment of the method he had inherited and improved. Most people
know him solely through one misquotation, the famous phrase that
&ldquo;the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile.&rdquo;
This is not only an imperfect statement of his doctrine: it suppresses
precisely the idea by which Cabanis differentiates from pure
&ldquo;sensationalism.&rdquo; What he taught was that
&ldquo;<i>impressions, reaching the brain, set it in activity</i>, as
aliments reaching the stomach excite it to a more abundant secretion of
gastric juice.... The function proper to the first is to perceive
particular impressions, to attach to them signs, to combine different
impressions, to separate them, to draw from them judgments and
determinations, as the function of the second is to act on nutritive
substances,&rdquo; etc.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26913src" href=
"#xd21e26913" name="xd21e26913src">230</a> It is after this statement
of the known processus, and after pointing out that there is as much of
pure inference in the one case as in the other, that he concludes:
&ldquo;The brain in a manner digests impressions, and makes organically
the secretion of thought&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb461"
href="#pb461" name="pb461">461</a>]</span>and this conclusion, he
points out, disposes of the difficulty of those who &ldquo;cannot
conceive how judging, reasoning, imagining, can ever be anything else
than feeling. The difficulty ceases when one recognizes, in these
different operations, the action of the brain upon the impressions
which are passed on to it.&rdquo; The doctrine is, in short, an
elementary truth of psychological science, as distinguished from the
pseudo-science of the Ego considered as an entity. To that
pseudo-science Cabanis gave a vital wound; and his derided formula is
for true science to-day almost a truism. The attacks made upon his
doctrine in the next generation only served to emphasize anew the
eternal dilemma of theism. On the one hand his final
&ldquo;vitalism&rdquo; was repugnant to those who, on traditional
lines, insisted upon a distinction between &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and
&ldquo;vital force&rdquo;; on the other hand, those who sought to make
a philosophic case for theism against him made the usual plunge into
pantheism, and were reproached accordingly by the orthodox.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e26921src" href="#xd21e26921" name=

&ldquo;positive&rdquo; gain.</p>
<p id="ch21.4.3" class="par">3. In England the influence of the French
stimulus in physiology was seen even more clearly than that of the
great generalization of Laplace. Professor William Lawrence
(1783&ndash;1867), the physiologist, published in 1816 an
<i>Introduction to Comparative Anatomy and Physiology</i>, containing
some remarks on the nature of life, which elicited from the then famous
Dr. Abernethy a foul attack in his <i>Physiological Lectures</i>
delivered before the College of Surgeons. Lawrence was charged with
belonging to the party of French physiological skeptics whose aim was
to &ldquo;loosen those restraints on which the welfare of mankind
depends.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26935src" href="#xd21e26935"
name="xd21e26935src">232</a> In the introductory lecture of his course
of 1817 before the College of Physicians, Lawrence severely retaliated,
repudiating the general charge, but reasserting that the dependence of
life on organization is as clear as the derivation of daylight from the
sun. The war was adroitly carried at once into the enemy&rsquo;s
territory in the declaration that &ldquo;The profound, the virtuous,
and fervently pious Pascal acknowledged, what all sound theologians
maintain, that the immortality of the soul, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb462" href="#pb462" name="pb462">462</a>]</span>the
great truths of religion, and the fundamental principles of morals
cannot be demonstrably proved by mere reason; and that revelation alone
is capable of dissipating the uncertainties which perplex those who
inquire too curiously into the sources of these important principles.
All will acknowledge that, as no other remedy can be so perfect and
satisfactory as this, no other can be necessary, if we resort to this
with firm faith.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26943src" href=
"#xd21e26943" name="xd21e26943src">233</a> The value of this
pronouncement is indicated later in the same volume by subacid
allusions to &ldquo;those who regard the Hebrew Scriptures as writings
composed with the assistance of divine inspiration,&rdquo; and who
receive Genesis &ldquo;as a narrative of actual events.&rdquo;
Indicating various &ldquo;grounds of doubt respecting
inspiration,&rdquo; the lecturer adds that the stories of the naming of
the animals and their collection in the ark, &ldquo;if we are to
understand them as applied to the living inhabitants of the whole
world, are zoologically impossible.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e26953src" href="#xd21e26953" name="xd21e26953src">234</a> On the
principle then governing such matters Lawrence was in 1822, on the
score of his heresies, refused copyright in his lectures, which were
accordingly reprinted many times in a cheap stereotyped edition, and
thus widely diffused.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26958src" href=
"#xd21e26958" name="xd21e26958src">235</a></p>
<p class="par">This hardy attack was reinforced in 1819 by the
publication of Sir T. C. Morgan&rsquo;s <i>Sketches of the Philosophy
of Life</i>, wherein the physiological materialism of Cabanis is
quietly but firmly developed, and a typical sentence of his figures as
a motto on the title-page. The method is strictly naturalistic, alike
on the medical and on the philosophic side; and &ldquo;vitalism&rdquo;
is argued down as explicitly as is anthropomorphism.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e26966src" href="#xd21e26966" name="xd21e26966src">236</a> As a

upon English.</p>
<p id="ch21.4.4" class="par">4. A more general effect, however, was
probably wrought by the science of geology, which in a stable and
tested form belongs to the nineteenth century. Of its theoretic
founders in the eighteenth century, Werner and Dr. <span class=
"sc">James Hutton</span> (1726&ndash;1797), the latter and more
important<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26986src" href="#xd21e26986" name=
"xd21e26986src">237</a> is known from his <i>Investigation of the
Principles of Knowledge</i> (1794) to have been consciously a
freethinker on more grounds than that of his naturalistic science; and
his <i>Theory of the World</i> (1795) was duly denounced as
atheistic.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26998src" href="#xd21e26998"
name="xd21e26998src">238</a> Whereas the physical infinity of the
universe almost forced the orthodox to concede a vast cosmic process of
some kind as preceding the shaping <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463"
href="#pb463" name="pb463">463</a>]</span>of the earth and solar
system, the formation of these within six days was one of the plainest
assertions in the sacred books; and every system of geology excluded
such a conception. As the evidence accumulated, in the hands of men
mostly content to deprecate religious opposition,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27004src" href="#xd21e27004" name="xd21e27004src">239</a> there
was duly evolved the quaint compromise of the doctrine that the
Biblical six &ldquo;days&rdquo; meant six ages&mdash;a fantasy still
cherished in the pulpit. On the ground of that absurdity, nevertheless,
there gradually grew up a new conception of the antiquity of the earth.
Thus a popular work on geology such as <i>The Ancient World</i>, by
Prof. Ansted (1847), could begin with the proposition that &ldquo;long
before the human race had been introduced on the earth this world of
ours existed as the habitation of living things different from those
now inhabiting its surface.&rdquo; Even the thesis of &ldquo;six
ages,&rdquo; and others of the same order, drew upon their supporters
angry charges of &ldquo;infidelity.&rdquo; Hugh Miller, whose natural
gifts for geological research were chronically turned to confusion by
his orthodox bias, was repeatedly so assailed, when in point of fact he
was perpetually tampering with the facts to salve the
Scriptures.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27010src" href="#xd21e27010"
name="xd21e27010src">240</a> Of all the inductive sciences geology had
been most retarded by the Christian canonization of error.<a class=

"xd21e27025src">241</a> Even the plain fact that what is dry land had

Ovid<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27031src" href="#xd21e27031" name=
"xd21e27031src">242</a> had put the observations of Pythagoras in the
way of all scholars; and though Leonardo da Vinci had insisted on the
visible evidence; nay, deistic habit could keep even Voltaire, as we
saw, preposterously incredulous on the subject. When the scientific
truth began to force its way in the teeth of such authorities as
Cuvier, who stood for the &ldquo;Mosaic&rdquo; doctrine, the effect was
proportionately marked; and whether or not the suicide of Miller (1856)
was in any way due to despair on perception of the collapse of his
reconciliation of geology with Genesis,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27037src" href="#xd21e27037" name="xd21e27037src">243</a> the
scientific demonstration made an end of revelationism for many. What
helped most to save orthodoxy from humiliation on the scientific side
was the attitude of men like Professor Baden <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name=
"pb464">464</a>]</span>Powell, whose scientific knowledge and habit of
mind moved him to attack the Judaism of the Bibliolaters in the name of
Christianity, and in the name of truth to declare that &ldquo;nothing
in geology bears the smallest semblance to any part of the Mosaic
cosmogony, torture the interpretation to what extent we
may.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27045src" href="#xd21e27045"
name="xd21e27045src">244</a> In 1857 this was very bold language.</p>
<p id="ch21.4.5" class="par">5. Still more rousing, finally, was the
effect of the science of zoology, as placed upon a broad scientific
foundation by <span class="sc">Charles Darwin</span>. Here again steps
had been taken in previous generations on the right path, without any
general movement on the part of scientific and educated men.
Darwin&rsquo;s own grandfather, <span class="sc">Erasmus Darwin</span>,
had in his <i>Zoonomia</i> (1794) anticipated many of the positions of
the French <span class="sc">Lamarck</span>, who in 1801 began
developing the views he fully elaborated in 1815, as to the descendance
of all existing species from earlier forms.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27064src" href="#xd21e27064" name="xd21e27064src">245</a> As
early as 1795 <span class="sc">Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</span> had begun
to suspect that all species are variants on a primordial form of life;
and at the same time (1794&ndash;95) Goethe in Germany had reached
similar convictions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27077src" href=
"#xd21e27077" name="xd21e27077src">246</a> That views thus reached
almost simultaneously in Germany, England, and France, at the time of
the French Revolution, should have to wait for two generations before
even meeting the full stress of battle, must be put down as one of the
results of the general reaction. Saint-Hilaire, publishing his views in
1828, was officially overborne by the Cuvier school in France. In
England, indeed, so late as 1855, we find Sir David Brewster denouncing
the Nebular Hypothesis: &ldquo;that dull and dangerous heresy of the
age.... An omnipotent arm was required to give the planets their
position and motion in space, and a presiding intelligence to assign to
them the different functions they had to perform.&rdquo;<a class=

"xd21e27086src">247</a> And Murchison the geologist was no less
emphatic against Darwinism, which he rejected till his dying day
(1871).</p>
<p id="ch21.4.6" class="par">6. Other anticipations of Darwin&rsquo;s
doctrine in England and elsewhere came practically to nothing,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e27096src" href="#xd21e27096" name=
"xd21e27096src">248</a> as regarded the general opinion, until
<span class="sc">Robert Chambers</span> in 1844 published anonymously
his <i>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</i>, a work which
found a wide audience, incurring bitter hostility not only from the
clergy but from some specialists who, like Huxley, were later to take
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href="#pb465" name=
"pb465">465</a>]</span>evolutionist view on Darwin&rsquo;s persuasion.
Chambers it was that brought the issue within general knowledge; and he
improved his position in successive editions. A hostile clerical
reader, Whewell, admitted of him, in a letter to a less hostile member
of his profession, that, &ldquo;as to the degree of resemblance between
the author and the French physiological atheists, he uses reverent
phrases: theirs would not be tolerated in England&rdquo;; adding:
&ldquo;You would be surprised to hear the contempt and abhorrence with
which Owen and Sedgwick speak of the <i>Vestiges</i>.&rdquo;<a class=

"xd21e27114src">249</a> Hugh Miller, himself accused of
&ldquo;infidelity&rdquo; for his measure of inductive candour, held a

&ldquo;reptiles,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27126src" href=

the new doctrine of evolution, which, as put by Chambers, was then
coming forward to evict his own delusions from the field of science.
The young Max M&uuml;ller, with the certitude born of an entire
ignorance of physical science, declared in 1856 that the doctrine of a
human evolution from lower types &ldquo;can never be maintained
again,&rdquo; and pronounced it an &ldquo;unhallowed
imputation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27137src" href=

<p id="ch21.4.7" class="par">7. &ldquo;Contempt and abhorrence&rdquo;
had in fact at all times constituted the common Christian temper
towards every form of critical dissent from the body of received
opinion; and only since the contempt, doubled with criticism, began to
be in a large degree retorted on the bigots by instructed men has a
better spirit prevailed. Such a reaction was greatly promoted by the
establishment of the Darwinian theory. It was after the above-noted
preparation, popular and academic, and after the theory of
transmutation of species had been definitely pronounced erroneous by
the omniscient Whewell,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27147src" href=
"#xd21e27147" name="xd21e27147src">253</a> that Darwin produced (1859)
his irresistible arsenal of arguments and facts, the <i>Origin of
Species</i>, expounding systematically the principle of Natural
Selection, suggested to him by the economic philosophy of Malthus, and
independently and contemporaneously arrived at by Dr. Alfred Russel
Wallace. The outcry was enormous; and the Church, as always, arrayed
itself violently against the new truth. Bishop Wilberforce pointed out
in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> that &ldquo;the principle of natural
selection is absolutely incompatible with the word of
God,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27164src" href="#xd21e27164"
name="xd21e27164src">254</a> which was perfectly true; and at a famous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466" name=
"pb466">466</a>]</span>meeting of the British Association in 1860 he so
travestied the doctrine as to goad Huxley into a fierce declaration
that he would rather be a descendant of an ape than of a man who (like
the Bishop) plunged into questions with which he had no real
acquaintance, only to obscure them and distract his hearers by appeals
to religious prejudice.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27172src" href=
"#xd21e27172" name="xd21e27172src">255</a> The mass of the clergy kept
up the warfare of ignorance; but the battle was practically won within
twenty years. In France, Germany, and the United States leading
theologians had made the same suicidal declarations, entitling all men
to say that, if evolution proved to be true, Christianity was false.
Professor Luthardt, of Leipzig, took up the same position as Bishop
Wilberforce, declaring that &ldquo;the whole superstructure of personal
religion is built upon the doctrine of creation&rdquo;;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e27178src" href="#xd21e27178" name=
"xd21e27178src">256</a> leading American theologians pronounced the new

<p id="ch21.4.8" class="par">8. Thus the idea of a specific creation of
all forms of life by an originating deity&mdash;the conception which
virtually united the deists and Christians of the eighteenth century
against the atheists&mdash;was at length scientifically exploded. The
principle of personal divine rule or providential intervention had now
been philosophically excluded successively (1) from astronomy by the
system of Newton; (2) from the science of earth-formation by the system
of Laplace and the new geology; (3) from the science of living
organisms by the new zoology. It only needed that the deistic
conception should be further excluded from the human
sciences&mdash;from anthropology, from the philosophy of history, and
from ethics&mdash;to complete, at least in outline, the rationalization
of modern thought. Not that the process was complete in detail even as
regarded zoology. Despite the plain implications of the <i>Origin of
Species</i>, the doctrine of the <i>Descent of Man</i> (1871) came on
many as a shocking surprise and evoked a new fury of protest. The
lacun&aelig; in Darwin, further, had to be supplemented; and much
speculative power has been spent on the task by <span class=
"sc">Haeckel</span>, without thus far establishing complete agreement.
But the desperate stand so long made on the score of the &ldquo;missing
link&rdquo; seems to have been finally discredited in 1894; and the
Jud&aelig;o-Christian doctrine of special creation and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href="#pb467" name=

imperfectly educated society of our day, to be already a lost
cause.</p>
<p class="par">As we have seen, however, it was not merely the clerical
class that resisted the new truth: the men of science themselves were
often disgracefully hostile; and that &ldquo;class&rdquo; continued to
give a sufficiency of support to clericalism. If the study of the
physical sciences be no guarantee for recognition of new truth in those
sciences, still less is it a sure preparation for right judgment in
matters of sociology, or, indeed, for a courageous attitude towards
conventions. Spencer in his earlier works used the language of
deism<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27202src" href="#xd21e27202" name=
"xd21e27202src">258</a> at a time when Comte had discarded it. It takes
a rare combination of intellectual power, moral courage, and official
freedom to permit of such a directly rationalistic propaganda as was
carried on by Professor <span class="sc">Clifford</span>, or even such
as has been accomplished by President <span class="sc">Andrew
White</span> in America under the comparatively popular profession of
deism. It was only in his leisured latter years that Huxley carried on
a general conflict with orthodoxy. In middle age he frequently covered
himself by attacks on professed freethinkers; and he did more than any
other man of his time in England to conserve the Bible as a school
manual by his politic panegyric of it in that aspect at a time when
bolder rationalists were striving to get it excluded from the State
schools.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27216src" href="#xd21e27216" name=
"xd21e27216src">259</a> Other men of science have furnished an
abundance of support to orthodoxy by more or less vaguely religious
pronouncements on the problem of the universe; so that Catholic and

quasi-scientific phrases<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27222src" href=

Physicists who attempt to be more precise are rarely found to be
orthodox; and the moral and social science of such writers is too often
a species of charlatanism. But the whole tendency of natural science,
which as such is necessarily alien to supernaturalism, makes for a
rejection of the religious tradition; and the real leaders of science
are found more and more openly alienated from the creed of faith. We
know that Darwin, though the son and grandson of freethinkers, was
brought up in ordinary orthodoxy by his mother, and &ldquo;gave up
common religious belief almost independently from his own
reflections.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27229src" href=

<p id="ch21.5.1" class="par first">1. A rationalistic treatment of
human history had been explicit or implicit in the whole literature of
Deism; and had been attempted with various degrees of success by Bodin,
Vico, Montesquieu, Mandeville, Hume, Smith, Voltaire, Volney, and
Condorcet, as well as by lesser men.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27242src" href="#xd21e27242" name="xd21e27242src">262</a> So
clear had been the classic lead to naturalistic views of social growth
in the <i>Politics</i> of Aristotle, and so strong the influence of the
new naturalistic spirit, that it is seen even in the work of Goguet
(1769), who sets out as biblically as Bossuet; while in Germany Herder
and Kant framed really luminous generalizations; and a whole group of
sociological writers rose up in the Scotland of the middle and latter
parts of the century.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27251src" href=
"#xd21e27251" name="xd21e27251src">263</a> Here again there was
reaction; but in France the orthodox Guizot did much to promote broader
views than his own; <span class="sc">Eus&egrave;be Salverte</span> in
his essay <i lang="fr">De la Civilisation</i> (1813) made a highly
intelligent effort towards a general view; and <span class="sc">Charles
Comte</span> in his <i lang="fr">Trait&eacute; de
L&eacute;gislation</i> (1826) made a marked scientific advance on the
suggestive work of Herder. As we have seen, the eclectic Jouffroy put
human affairs in the sphere of natural law equally with cosmic
phenomena. At length, in the great work of <span class="sc">Auguste
Comte</span>, scientific method was applied so effectively and
concretely to the general problem that, despite his serious fallacies,
social science again took rank as a solid study.</p>
<p id="ch21.5.2" class="par">2. In England the anti-revolution reaction
was visible in this as in other fields of thought. Hume and Gibbon had
set the example of a strictly naturalistic treatment of history; and
the clerical Robertson was faithful to their method; but Hallam makes a
stand for supernaturalism even in applying a generally scientific
critical standard. The majority of historical events he is content to
let pass as natural, even as the average man sees the hand of the
doctor in his escape from rheumatism, but the hand of God in his escape
from a railway accident. Discussing the defeat of Barbarossa at
Legnano, Hallam pronounces that it is not &ldquo;material to allege ...
that the accidental destruction of Frederic&rsquo;s army by disease
enabled the cities of Lombardy to succeed in their resistance....
Providence reserves to itself various means by which the bonds of the
oppressor may be broken; and it is not for human sagacity to anticipate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span>whether the army of a conqueror shall moulder in
the unwholesome marshes of Rome or stiffen with frost in a Russian
winter.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27277src" href="#xd21e27277"
name="xd21e27277src">264</a></p>
<p class="par">But Hallam was nearly the last historian of distinction
to vend such nugatory oracles as either a philosophy or a religion of
history. Even the oracular Carlyle did not clearly stipulate for
&ldquo;special providences&rdquo; in his histories, though he leant to
that conception; and though Ranke also uses mystifying language, he
writes as a Naturalist; while Michelet is openly anti-clerical. Grote
was wholly a rationalist; the historic method of his friend and
competitor, Bishop Thirlwall, was as non-theological as his; Macaulay,
whatever might be his conformities or his bias, wrote in his most
secular spirit when exhibiting theological evolution; and George Long
indicated his rationalism again and again.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27284src" href="#xd21e27284" name="xd21e27284src">265</a> It is
only in the writings of the most primitively prejudiced of those German
historians who eliminate ethics from historiography that the
&ldquo;God&rdquo; factor is latterly emphasized in ostensibly expert
historiography.</p>
<p id="ch21.5.3" class="par">3. All study of economics and of political
history fostered such views, and at length, in England and America, by
the works of <span class="sc">Draper</span> and <span class=
"sc">Buckle</span>, in the sixth and later decades of the century, the
conception of law in human history was widely if slowly popularized, to
the due indignation of the supernaturalists, who saw the last great
field of natural phenomena passing like others into the realm of
science. Draper&rsquo;s avowed theism partly protected him from attack;
but Buckle&rsquo;s straightforward attacks on creeds and on Churches
brought upon him a peculiarly fierce hostility, which was unmollified
by his incidental avowal of belief in a future life and his erratic
attacks upon unbelievers. For long this hostility told against his
sociological teaching. Spencer&rsquo;s <i>Principles of Sociology</i>
nevertheless clinched the scientific claim by taking sociological law
for granted; and the new science has continually progressed in
acceptance. In the hands of all its leading modern exponents in all
countries&mdash;Lester Ward, Giddings, Guyau, Letourneau, Tarde, Ferri,
Durkheim, De Greef, Gumplowicz, Lilienfeld, Sch&auml;ffle&mdash;it has
been entirely naturalistic, though some Catholic professors continue to
inject into it theological assumptions. It cannot be said, however,
that a general doctrine of social evolution is even yet fully
established. The problem is complicated by the profoundly contentious
issues of practical politics; and in the resulting diffidence of
official teachers there arises a notable opening for obscurantism,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name=
"pb470">470</a>]</span>which has been duly forthcoming. In the first
half of the century such an eminent Churchman as Dean Milman incurred
at the hands of J. H. Newman and others the charge of writing the
history of the Jews and of early Christianity in a rationalistic
spirit, presenting religion as a &ldquo;human&rdquo;
phenomenon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27309src" href="#xd21e27309"
name="xd21e27309src">266</a> Later Churchmen, with all their
preparation, have rarely gone further.</p>
<p id="ch21.5.4" class="par">4. Two lines of scientific study, it would
appear, must be thoroughly followed up before the ground can be
pronounced clear for authoritative conclusions&mdash;those of
anthropological arch&aelig;ology (including comparative mythology and
comparative hierology) and economic analysis. On both lines, however,
great progress has been made; and on the former in particular the
result is profoundly disintegrating to traditional belief. The lessons
of anthropology had been long available to the modern world before they
began to be scientifically applied to the &ldquo;science of
religion.&rdquo; The issues raised by Fontenelle and De Brosses in the
eighteenth century were in practice put aside in favour of direct
debate over Christian history, dogma, and ethic; though many of the
deists dwelt on the analogies of &ldquo;heathen&rdquo; and
&ldquo;revealed&rdquo; religion. As early as 1824 Benjamin Constant
made a vigorous attempt to bring the whole phenomena under a general
evolutionary conception in his work <i lang="fr">De la
Religion</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27320src" href="#xd21e27320"
name="xd21e27320src">267</a> But it was not till the treasure of modern
anthropology had been scientifically massed by such students as Theodor
Waitz (<i lang="de">Anthropologie der Naturv&ouml;lker</i>, 6 Bde.
1859&ndash;71) and Adolf Bastian (<i lang="de">Der Mensch in der
Geschichte</i>, 3 Bde. 1860), and above all by Sir <span class=
"sc">Edward Tylor</span>, who first lucidly elaborated the science of
it all, that the arbitrary religious conception of the psychic
evolution of humanity began to be decisively superseded.</p>
<p class="par">In 1871 Tylor could still say that &ldquo;to many
educated minds there seems something presumptuous and repulsive in the
view that the history of mankind is part and parcel of the history of
nature; that our thoughts, wills, and actions accord with laws as
definite as those which govern the motion of waves, the combination of
acids and bases, and the growth of plants and animals.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e27337src" href="#xd21e27337" name=
"xd21e27337src">268</a> But the old repulsion had already been
profoundly impaired by biological and social science; and Tylor&rsquo;s
book met with hardly any of the odium that had been lavished on Darwin
and Buckle. &ldquo;It will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href=
"#pb471" name="pb471">471</a>]</span>make me for the future look on
religion&mdash;a belief in the soul, etc.&mdash;from a different point
of view,&rdquo; wrote Darwin<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27344src" href=
"#xd21e27344" name="xd21e27344src">269</a> to Tylor on its appearance.
So thoroughly did the book press home the fact of the evolution of
religious thought from savagery that thenceforward the science of
mythology, which had never yet risen in professional hands to the
height of vision of Fontenelle, began to be decisively adapted to the
anthropological standpoint.</p>
<p class="par">In the hands of Spencer<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27351src" href="#xd21e27351" name="xd21e27351src">270</a> all the
phenomena of primitive mental life&mdash;beliefs, practices,
institutions&mdash;are considered as purely natural data, no other
point of view being recognized; and the anthropological treatises of
Lord Avebury (Sir John Lubbock) are at the same standpoint. When at
length the mass of savage usages which lie around the beginnings of
historic religion began to be closely scanned and classified, notably
in the great latter-day compilations of Sir J. G. Frazer, what had
appeared to be sacred peculiarities of the Christian cult were seen to
be but variants of universal primitive practice. Thenceforth the
problem for serious inquirers was not whether Christianity was a
supernatural revelation&mdash;the supernatural is no longer a ground of
serious discussion&mdash;but whether the central narrative is
historical in any degree whatever. The defence is latterly conducted
from a standpoint indistinguishable from the Unitarian. But an enormous
amount of anthropological research is being carried on without any
reference to such issues, the total effect being to exclude the
supernaturalist premiss from the study of religion as completely as
from that of astronomy.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch21.6.1" class="par first">1. The philosophy of Kant, while
giving the theological class a new apparatus of defence as against
common-sense freethinking, forced none the less on theistic philosophy
a great advance from the orthodox positions. Thus his immediate
successors, Fichte and Schelling, produced systems of which one was
loudly denounced as atheistic, and the other as pantheistic,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e27362src" href="#xd21e27362" name=
"xd21e27362src">271</a> despite its dualism. Neither seems to have had
much influence on concrete religious opinion outside the
universities;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27368src" href="#xd21e27368"
name="xd21e27368src">272</a> and when Schelling in old age turned
Catholic obscurantist, the gain to clericalism was not great. Hegel in
turn loosely wrought out a system of which the great merit is to
substitute the conception of existence as relation for the nihilistic
idealism of Fichte and the unsolved dualism of Schelling. This
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472" name=
"pb472">472</a>]</span>system he latterly adapted to practical
exigencies<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27375src" href="#xd21e27375"
name="xd21e27375src">273</a> by formulating, as Kant had recently done,
a philosophic Trinity and hardily defining Christianity as
&ldquo;Absolute Religion&rdquo; in comparison with the various forms of
&ldquo;Natural Religion.&rdquo; Nevertheless, he counted in a great
degree as a disintegrating influence, and was in a very practical way
anti-Christian. More explicitly than Kant, he admitted that the
<i lang="de">Aufkl&auml;rung</i>, the freethinking movement of the past
generation, had made good its case so far as it went; and though, by
the admission of admirers, he took for granted without justification
that it had carried its point with the world at large,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e27385src" href="#xd21e27385" name=
"xd21e27385src">274</a> he was chronically at strife with the
theologians as such, charging them on the one hand with deserting the
dogmas which he re-stated,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27391src" href=
"#xd21e27391" name="xd21e27391src">275</a> and on the other declaring
that the common run of them &ldquo;know as little of God as a blind man
sees of a painting, even though he handles the frame.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e27399src" href="#xd21e27399" name=
"xd21e27399src">276</a> Of the belief in miracles he was simply
contemptuous. &ldquo;Whether at the marriage of Cana the guests got a
little more wine or a little less is a matter of absolutely no
importance; nor is it any more essential to demand whether the man with
the withered hand was healed; for millions of men go about with
withered and crippled limbs, whose limbs no man heals.&rdquo; On the
story of the marks made for the information of the angel on the Hebrew
houses at the Passover he asks: &ldquo;Would the angel not have known
them without these marks?&rdquo;, adding: &ldquo;This faith has no real
interest for Spirit.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27404src" href=
"#xd21e27404" name="xd21e27404src">277</a> Such writing, from the
orthodox point of view, was not compensated for by a philosophy of
Christianity which denaturalized its dogmas, and a presentment of the
God-idea and of moral law which made religion alternately a phase of
philosophy and a form of political utilitarianism.</p>

<p class="par">The gist of Hegel&rsquo;s rehabilitation of Christianity
is well set forth by Prof. A. Seth Pringle-Pattison in his essay on
<i>The Philosophy of Religion in Kant and Hegel</i> (rep. in <i>The
Philos. Radicals and other Essays</i>, 1907), ch. iii. Considered in
connection with his demonstration that in politics the Prussian State
was the ideal government, it is seen to be even more of an arbitrary
and unveridical accommodation to the social environment than
Kant&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen
Vernunft</i>. It approximates intellectually to the process by which
the neo-Platonists and other eclectics of the classic decadence found a
semblance of allegorical or symbolical justification for every item in
the old theology. Nothing could be more false to the spirit of
Hegel&rsquo;s general philosophy than the representing of Christianity
as a culmination or &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; of all religion; and
nothing, in fact, was more readily seen by his contemporaries.</p>
<p class="par">We who look back, however, may take a more lenient view
of Hegel&rsquo;s process of adaptation than was taken in the next
generation by Haym, who, in his <i lang="de">Hegel und seine Zeit</i>
(1857), presented him as always following the prevailing fashion in
thought, and lending himself as the tool of reactionary government.
Hegel&rsquo;s officialism was in the main probably wholehearted. Even
as Kant felt driven to do something for social conservation at the
outbreak of the French Revolution, and Fichte to shape for his country
the sinister ideal of <i>The Closed Industrial State</i>, so Hegel,
after seeing Prussia shaken to its foundations at the battle of Jena
and being turned out of his own house by the looting French soldiers,
was very naturally impelled to support the existing State by
quasi-philosophico-religious considerations. It was an abandonment of
the true function of philosophy; but it may have been done in all good
faith. An intense political conservatism was equally marked in Strauss,
who dreaded &ldquo;demagogy,&rdquo; and in Schopenhauer, who left his
fortune to the fund for the widows and families of soldiers killed or
injured in the revolutionary strifes of 1848. It came in their case
from the same source&mdash;an alarmed memory of social convulsion. The
fact remains that Hegel had no real part in the State religion which he
crowned with formulas.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Not only does Hegel&rsquo;s conception of the Absolute
make deity simply the eternal process of the universe, and the divine
consciousness indistinguishable from the total consciousness of
mankind,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27463src" href="#xd21e27463" name=

all creeds;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27469src" href="#xd21e27469"

succeeding movements of German <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474"
href="#pb474" name="pb474">474</a>]</span>thought&mdash;as those of
Vatke, Strauss,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27474src" href="#xd21e27474"
name="xd21e27474src">280</a> Feuerbach, and Marx&mdash;professedly
founded on him. It is certainly a striking testimony to the influence
of Hegel that five such powerful innovators as Vatke<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e27480src" href="#xd21e27480" name="xd21e27480src">281</a> in
Old-Testament, Bruno Bauer and Strauss in New-Testament criticism,
Feuerbach in the philosophy of religion, and Marx in social philosophy,
should at first fly the Hegelian flag. It can hardly have been that
Hegel&rsquo;s formulas sufficed to generate the criticism they all
brought to bear upon their subject matter; rather we must suppose that
their naturally powerful minds were attracted by the critical and
reconstructive aspects of his doctrine; but the philosophy which
stimulated them must have had great affinities for revolution, as well
as for all forms of the idea of evolution.</p>
<p id="ch21.6.2" class="par">2. In respect of his formal championship
of Christianity Hegel&rsquo;s method, arbitrary even for him, appealed
neither to the orthodox nor, with a few exceptions,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e27491src" href="#xd21e27491" name="xd21e27491src">282</a> to
his own disciples, some of whom, as Ruge, at length definitely
renounced Christianity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27501src" href=
"#xd21e27501" name="xd21e27501src">283</a> In 1854 Heine told his

suffering and of revived poetic religiosity, could see in Hegel&rsquo;s
system only atheism. <span class="sc">Bruno Bauer</span> at first

being even less sustaining to orthodoxy, and later orthodox systems
failing to impress, there came in due course the cry of &ldquo;Back to
Kant,&rdquo; where at least orthodoxy had some formal semblance of
sanction.</p>
<p class="par">Hartmann&rsquo;s work on <i>The Self-Decomposition of
Christianity</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e27537src" href=
"#xd21e27537" name="xd21e27537src">286</a> is a stringent exposure of
the unreality of what passed for &ldquo;liberal Christianity&rdquo; in
Germany a generation ago, and an appeal for a &ldquo;new concrete
religion&rdquo; of monism or pantheism as a bulwark against
Ultramontanism. On this monism, however, Hartmann insisted on grounding
his pessimism; and with this pessimistic pantheism he hoped to outbid
Catholicism against the &ldquo;irreligious&rdquo; Strauss and the
liberal Christians&mdash;in his view no less irreligious. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475" name="pb475">475</a>]</span>It
does not seem to have had much acceptance. On the whole, the effect of
all German philosophy has probably been to make for the general
discredit of theistic thinking, the surviving forms of Hegelianism
being little propitious to current religion. And though Schopenhauer
and <span class="sc">Nietzsche</span> can hardly be said to carry on
the task of philosophy either in spirit or in effect, yet the rapid
intensification of hostility to current religion which their writings
in particular manifest<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27550src" href=
"#xd21e27550" name="xd21e27550src">287</a> must be admitted to stand
for a deep revolt against the Kantian compromise. And this revolt was
bound to come about. The truth-shunning tactic of Kant, Fichte, and
Hegel&mdash;aiming at the final discrediting of the <i lang=
"de">Aufkl&auml;rung</i> as a force that had done its work, and could
find no more to do, however it be explained and excused&mdash;was a
mere expression of their own final lack of scientific instinct. It is
hard to believe that thinkers who had perceived and asserted the fact
of progression in religion could suppose that true philosophy consisted
in putting a stop on &agrave; priori grounds to the historical
analysis, and setting up an &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; of philosophic
theory. The straightforward investigators, seeking simply for truth,
have passed on to posterity a spirit which, correcting their inevitable
errors, reaches a far deeper and wider comprehension of religious
evolution and psychosis than could be reached by the verbalizing
methods of the self-satisfied and self-sufficing metaphysicians. These,
so far as they prevailed, did but delay the advance of real knowledge.
Their work, in fact, was fatally shaped by the general reaction against
the Revolution, which in their case took a quasi-philosophic form,
while in France and England it worked out as a crude return to clerical
and political authoritarianism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27572src"

<p id="ch21.6.3" class="par">3. From the collisions of philosophic
systems in Germany there emerged two great practical freethinking
forces, the teachings of <span class="sc">Ludwig Feuerbach</span>
(1804&ndash;76), who was obliged to give up his lecturing at Erlangen
in 1830 after the issue of his <i>Thoughts upon Death and
Immortality</i>, and <span class="sc">Ludwig B&uuml;chner</span>, who
was deprived of his chair of clinic at T&uuml;bingen in 1855 for his
<i>Force and Matter</i>. The former, originally a Hegelian, expressly
broke away from his master, declaring that, whereas Hegel belonged to
the &ldquo;Old Testament&rdquo; of modern philosophy, he himself would
set forth the New, wherein Hegel&rsquo;s fundamentally incoherent
treatment of deity (as the total process of things on the one hand, and
an objective <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name=

cured.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27598src" href="#xd21e27598" name=
"xd21e27598src">289</a> Feuerbach accordingly, in his <i>Essence of
Christianity</i> (1841) and <i>Essence of Religion</i> (1851), supplied
one of the first adequate modern statements of the positively
rationalistic position as against Christianity and theism, in terms of
philosophic as well as historical insight&mdash;a statement to which
there is no characteristically modern answer save in terms of the
refined sentimentalism of the youthful Renan,<a class="noteref" id=

fundamentally averse alike to scientific precision and to intellectual
consistency.</p>
<p class="par">Feuerbach&rsquo;s special service consists in the
rebuttal of the metaphysic in which religion had chronically taken
refuge from the straightforward criticism of freethinkers, in itself
admittedly unanswerable. They had shown many times over its historic
falsity, its moral perversity, and its philosophic self-contradiction;
and the more astute official defenders, leaving to the less competent
the task of re-vindicating miracles and prophecy and defending the
indefensible, proceeded to shroud the particular defeat in a
pseudo-philosophic process which claimed for all religion alike an
indestructible inner truth, in the light of which the instinctive
believer could again make shift to affirm his discredited credences. It
was this process which Feuerbach exploded, for all who cared to read
him. He had gone through it. Intensely religious in his youth, he had
found in the teaching of Hegel an attractive philosophic garb for his
intuitional thought. But a wider concern than Hegel&rsquo;s for actual
knowledge, and for the knowledge of the actual, moved him to say to his
teacher, on leaving: &ldquo;Two years have I attached myself to you;
two years have I completely devoted to your philosophy. Now I feel the
necessity of starting in the directly opposite way: I am going to study
anatomy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27621src" href="#xd21e27621"
name="xd21e27621src">291</a> It may have been that what saved him from
the Hegelian fate of turning to the end the squirrel-cage of conformist
philosophy was the personal experience which put him in fixed
antagonism to the governmental forces that Hegel was moved to serve.
The hostility evoked by his <i>Thoughts on Death and Immortality</i>
completed his alienation from the official side of things, and left him
to the life of a devoted truth-seeker&mdash;a career as rare in Germany
as elsewhere. The upshot was that Feuerbach, in the words of Strauss,
&ldquo;broke the double yoke in which, under Hegel, philosophy and
theology still went.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27630src" href=
"#xd21e27630" name="xd21e27630src">292</a></p>
<p class="par">For the task he undertook he had consummately equipped
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href="#pb477" name=
"pb477">477</a>]</span>himself. In a series of four volumes (<i>History
of Modern Philosophy from Bacon to Spinoza</i>, 1833; <i>Exposition and
Criticism of the Leibnitzian Philosophy</i>, 1837; <i>Pierre Bayle</i>,
1838; <i>On Philosophy and Christianity</i>, 1839) he explored the
field of philosophy, and re-studied theology in the light of moral and
historical criticism, before he produced his masterpiece, <i lang=
"de">Das Wesen des Christenthums</i>. Here the tactic of Hegel is
turned irresistibly on the Hegelian defence; and religion, defiantly
declared by Hegel to be an affair of self-consciousness,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e27661src" href="#xd21e27661" name=
"xd21e27661src">293</a> is shown to be in very truth nothing else.
&ldquo;Such as are a man&rsquo;s thoughts and dispositions, such is his
God; so much worth as a man has, so much and no more has his God.
Consciousness of God is self-consciousness; knowledge of God is
self-knowledge.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27669src" href=
"#xd21e27669" name="xd21e27669src">294</a> This of course is openly
what Hegelian theism is in effect&mdash;philosophic atheism; and though
Feuerbach at times disclaimed the term, he declares in his preface that
&ldquo;atheism, at least in the sense of this work, is the secret of
religion itself; that religion itself ... in its heart, in its essence,
believes in nothing else than the truth and divinity of human
nature.&rdquo; In the preliminary section on <i>The Essence of
Religion</i> he makes his position clear once for all: &ldquo;A God who
has abstract predicates has also an abstract existence.... Not the
attribute of the divinity, but the divineness or deity of the
attribute, is the first true Divine Being. Thus what theology and
philosophy have held to be God, the Absolute, the Infinite, is not God;
but that which they have held not to be God, is God&mdash;namely the
attribute, the quality, whatever has reality. Hence, he alone is the
true atheist to whom the predicates of the Divine Being&mdash;for
example, love, wisdom, justice&mdash;are nothing; not he to whom merely
the subject of these predicates is nothing.... These have an intrinsic,
independent reality; they force their recognition upon man by their
very nature; they are self-evident truths to him; they approve, they
attest themselves.... The idea of God is dependent on the idea of
justice, of benevolence....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This is obviously the answer to Baur, who, after paying
tribute to the personality of Feuerbach, and presenting a tolerably
fair summary of his critical philosophy, can find no answer to it save
the inept protest that it is one-sided in respect of its reduction of
religion to the subjective (the very course insisted on by a hundred
defenders!), that it favours the communistic and other extreme
tendencies of the time, and that it brings everything &ldquo;under the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name=

id="xd21e27681src" href="#xd21e27681" name="xd21e27681src">295</a> Here
a philosophic and an aspersive meaning are furtively combined in one
word. The scientific subjectivism of Feuerbach&rsquo;s analysis of
religion is no more a vindication or acceptance of &ldquo;rude
egoism&rdquo; than is the Christian formula of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
will&rdquo; a condonation of murder. The restraint of egoism by
altruism lies in human character and polity alike for the rationalist
and for the irrationalist, as Baur must have known well enough after
his long survey of Church history. His really contemptible escape from
Feuerbach&rsquo;s criticism, under cover of alternate cries of
&ldquo;Communism&rdquo; and &ldquo;egoism&rdquo;&mdash;a
self-stultification which needs no comment&mdash;is simply one more
illustration of the fashion in which, since the time of Kant,
philosophy in Germany as elsewhere has been chronically demoralized by
resort to non-philosophical tests. &ldquo;Max Stirner&rdquo; (pen-name
of Johann Caspar Schmidt, 1806&ndash;1856) carried the philosophic
&ldquo;egoism&rdquo; of Feuerbach about as far in words as might be;
but his work on the Ego (<i lang="de">Der Einzige und sein
Eigenthum</i>, 1845) remains an ethical curiosity rather than a
force.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27689src" href="#xd21e27689" name=

democracy and light; and if in 1870 he capitulated to the new Empire,
and thereby won a small pension for the two last years of his life, he
was but going the way of many another veteran, dazzled in his old age
by very old fires. His <i>Addresses on Religion, its Rise and Fall: to
the educated among its Reverers</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27704src" href="#xd21e27704" name="xd21e27704src">298</a> (1869)
is a lucid and powerful performance, proceeding from a mythological
analysis of religion to a cordial plea for rationalism in all things.
The charge of &ldquo;materialism&rdquo; was for him no bugbear.
&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;we are not without the earth and
the solar system, not without the plants and the animals, not without
head. But whoever has head enough to understand science and its
conquests in the field of nature and of mind (<i lang="de">Geist</i>)
knows also that the material world rests in the immaterial, moves in
it, and is by it animated, freed, and ensouled; that soul and idea are
incarnate in Nature, but that also logic, idea, spirit, and science
free themselves out of Nature, become abstracted and as immaterial
Power erect their own realm, the realm of spirit in State, science, and
art.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27712src" href="#xd21e27712"

error of substituting one apriorism for another. Whosoever endorses
Baur&rsquo;s protest against the &ldquo;one-sidedness&rdquo; of
Feuerbach, who treats of religion on its chosen ground of
self-consciousness, has but to turn to B&uuml;chner&rsquo;s study of
the objective world and see whether his cause fares any better.</p>
<p id="ch21.6.6" class="par">6. In France the course of thought had
been hardly less revolutionary. Philosophy, like everything else, had
been affected by the legitimist restoration; and between Victor Cousin
and the other &ldquo;classic philosophers&rdquo; of the first third of
the century orthodoxy was nominally reinstated. Yet even among these
there was no firm coherence. Maine de Biran, one of the shrinking
spirits who passed gradually into an intolerant authoritarianism from
fear of the perpetual pressures of reason, latterly declared (1821)
that a philosophy which ascribed to deity only infinite thought or
supreme intelligence, eliminating volition and love, was pure atheism;
and this pronouncement struck at the philosophy of Cousin. Nor was this
species of orthodoxy any more successful than the furious irrationalism
of Joseph De Maistre in setting up a philosophic form of faith, as
distinct from the cult of rhetoric and sentiment founded by
Chateaubriand. Cousin was deeply distrusted by those who knew him, and
at the height of his popularity he was contemned by the more competent
minds around him, such as Sainte-Beuve, Comte, and Edgar
Quinet.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27743src" href="#xd21e27743" name=
"xd21e27743src">302</a> The latter thinker himself counted for a
measure of rationalism, though he argued for theism, and undertook to
make good the historicity of Jesus against those who challenged it. For
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name=
"pb480">480</a>]</span>the rest, even among the ostensibly conservative
and official philosophers, Th&eacute;odore Jouffroy, an eclectic, who
held the chair of moral philosophy in the <span lang=
"fr">Facult&eacute; des Lettres</span> at Paris, was at heart an
unbeliever from his youth up,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27760src"
href="#xd21e27760" name="xd21e27760src">303</a> and even in his guarded
writings was far from satisfying the orthodox. &ldquo;God,&rdquo; he
wrote,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27763src" href="#xd21e27763" name=
"xd21e27763src">304</a> &ldquo;interposes as little in the regular
development of humanity as in the course of the solar system.&rdquo; He
added a fatalistic theorem of divine predetermination, which he
verbally salved in the usual way by saying that predetermination
presupposed individual liberty. Eclecticism thus fell, as usual,
between two stools; but it was not orthodoxy that would gain. On
another line Jouffroy openly bantered the authoritarians on their
appeal to a popular judgment which they declared to be incapable of
pronouncing on religious questions.<a class="noteref" id=

<p id="ch21.6.7" class="par">7. On retrospect, the whole official
French philosophy of the period, however conservative in profession, is
found to have been at bottom rationalistic, and only superficially
friendly to faith. The Abb&eacute; Felice de Lamennais declaimed warmly
against <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;indiff&eacute;rence en mati&egrave;re de
religion</i> (4 vols. 1818&ndash;24), resorting to the old Catholic
device, first employed by Montaigne, of turning Pyrrhonism against
unbelief. Having ostensibly discredited the authority of the senses and
the reason (by which he was to be read and understood), he proceeded in
the customary way to set up the ancient standard of the <i lang=
"la">consensus universalis</i>, the authority of the majority, the
least reflective and the most fallacious. This he sought to elevate
into a kind of corporate wisdom, superior to all individual judgment;
and he marched straight into the countersense of claiming the pagan
consensus as a confirmation of religion in general, while arguing for a
religion which claimed to put aside paganism as error. The final
logical content of the thesis was the inanity that the majority for the
time being must be right.</p>
<p class="par">Damiron, writing his <i lang="fr">Essai sur
l&rsquo;histoire de la philosophie en France au XIXe Si&egrave;cle</i>
in 1828, replies in a fashion more amiable than reassuring, commenting
on the &ldquo;strange skepticism&rdquo; of Lamennais as to the human
reason.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27791src" href="#xd21e27791" name=
"xd21e27791src">306</a> For himself, he takes up the parable of
Lessing, and declares that where Lessing spoke doubtfully, men had now
reached conviction. It was no longer a question of whether, but of
when, religion was to be recast in terms of fuller intelligence.
&ldquo;In this religious regeneration we shall be to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name=
"pb481">481</a>]</span>Christians what the Christians were to the Jews,
and the Jews to the patriarchs: we shall be Christians and something
more.&rdquo; The theologian of the future will be half-physicist,
half-philosopher. &ldquo;We shall study God through nature and through
men; and a new Messiah will not be necessary to teach us miraculously
what we can learn of ourselves and by our natural lights.&rdquo;
Christianity has been a useful discipline; but &ldquo;our education is
so advanced that henceforth we can be our own teachers; and, having no
need of an extraneous inspiration, we draw faith from
science.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27798src" href="#xd21e27798"
name="xd21e27798src">307</a> &ldquo;Prayer is good, doubtless,&rdquo;
but it &ldquo;has only a mysterious, uncertain, remote action on our
environment.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27803src" href=
"#xd21e27803" name="xd21e27803src">308</a> All this under Louis
Philippe, from a professor at the &Eacute;cole Normale. Not to this day
has official academic philosophy in Britain ventured to go so far. In
France the brains were never out, even under the Restoration. Lamennais
himself gave the proof. His employment of skepticism as an aid to faith
had been, like Montaigne&rsquo;s, the expression of a temperament slow
to reach rational positions, but surely driven thither. As a boy of
twelve, when a priest sought to prepare him for communion, he had shown
such abnormal incredulity that the priest gave him up; and later he
read omnivorously among the deists of the eighteenth century, Rousseau
attracting him in particular. Later he passed through a religious
crisis, slowly covering ground which others traverse early. He did not
become a communicant till he was twenty-two; he entered the seminary
only at twenty-seven; and he was ordained only when he was nearly
thirty-two.</p>
<p class="par">Yet he had experienced much. Already in 1808 his
<i lang="fr">R&eacute;flexions sur l&rsquo;&eacute;tat de
l&rsquo;&eacute;glise</i> had been suppressed by Napoleon&rsquo;s
police; in 1814 he had written, along with his brother, in whose
seminary he taught mathematics, a treatise maintaining the papal
claims; and in the Hundred Days of 1815 he took flight to London. His
mind was always at work. His <i>Essay on Indifference</i> expressed his
need of a conviction; with unbelief he could reckon and sympathize;
with indifference he could not; but when the indifference was by his
own account the result of reflective unbelief he treated it in the same
fashion as the spontaneous form. At bottom, his quarrel was with
reason. Yet the very element in his mind which prompted his
anti-rational polemic was ratiocinative; and as he slowly reached
clearness of thought he came more and more into conflict with
Catholicism. It was all very well to flout the individual reason in the
name of the universal; but to give mankind a total infallibility
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href="#pb482" name=
"pb482">482</a>]</span>was not the way to satisfy a pope or a Church
which claimed a monopoly of the gift. In 1824 he was well received by
the pope; but when in 1830 he began to write Liberal articles in the
journal <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Avenir</i>, in which he collaborated with
Lacordaire, the Comte de Montalembert, and other neo-Catholics, offence
was quickly taken, and the journal was soon suspended. Lamennais and
his disciples Lacordaire and Montalembert went to Rome to plead their
cause, but were coldly received; and on their way home in 1832 received
at Munich a missive of severe reprimand.</p>
<p class="par">Rendering formal obedience, Lamennais retired,
disillusioned, with his friends to his and his brother&rsquo;s estate
in Brittany, and began his process of intellectual severance. In
January, 1833, he performed mass, and at this stage he held by his
artificial distinction between the spheres of faith and reason. In May
of that year he declared his determination to place himself &ldquo;as a
writer outside of the Church and Catholicism,&rdquo; declaring that
&ldquo;outside of Catholicism, outside faith, there is reason; outside
of the Church there is humanity; I place myself (<i lang="fr">je me
renferme</i>) in this sphere.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27826src" href="#xd21e27826" name="xd21e27826src">309</a> Still
he claimed to be <i lang="fr">simple fid&egrave;le en religion</i>, and
to combine &ldquo;fidelity in obedience with liberty in
science.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27834src" href="#xd21e27834"
name="xd21e27834src">310</a> In January of 1834, however, he had ceased
to perform any clerical function; and his <i lang="fr">Paroles
d&rsquo;un Croyant</i>, published in that year, stand for a faith which
the Church reckoned as infidelity.</p>
<p class="par">Lacordaire, separating from his insubordinate colleague,
published an <i lang="fr">Examen de la philosophie de M. de
Lamennais</i>, in which the true papal standpoint was duly taken.
Thenceforth Lamennais was an Ishmaelite. Feeling as strongly in
politics as in everything else, he was infuriated by the brutal
suppression of the Polish rising in 1831&ndash;32; and the government
of Louis Philippe pleased him as little as that of Charles X had done.
In 1841 he was sentenced to a year&rsquo;s imprisonment for his
brochure <i lang="fr">Le pays et le gouvernement</i> (1840). Shortly
before his death in 1854 he claimed that he had never changed: &ldquo;I
have gone on, that is all.&rdquo; But he had in effect changed from a
Catholic to a pantheist;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27848src" href=
"#xd21e27848" name="xd21e27848src">311</a> and in 1848, as a member of
the National Assembly, he more than once startled his colleagues by
&ldquo;an affectation of impiety.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27854src" href="#xd21e27854" name="xd21e27854src">312</a> On his
deathbed he refused to receive the cur&eacute; of the parish, and by
his own wish he was buried without any religious ceremony, in the
<i lang="fr">fosse commune</i> of the poor and with no cross on his
grave. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href="#pb483" name=
"pb483">483</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Such a type does not very clearly belong to rationalism;
and Lamennais never enrolled himself save negatively under that flag.
Always emotional and impulsive, he had in his period of aggressive
fervour as a Churchman played a rather sinister part in the matter of
the temporary insanity of Auguste Comte, lending himself to the
unscrupulous tactics of the philosopher&rsquo;s mother, who did not
stick at libelling her son&rsquo;s wife in order to get him put under
clerical control.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27866src" href=
"#xd21e27866" name="xd21e27866src">313</a> It was perhaps well for him
that he was forced out of the Church; for his love of liberty was too
subjective to have qualified him for a wise use of power. But the
spectacle of such a temperament forced into antagonism with the Church
on moral and social grounds could not but stimulate anti-clericalism in
France, whatever his philosophy may have done to promote rational
thinking.</p>
<p id="ch21.6.8" class="par">8. The most energetic and characteristic
philosophy produced in the new France was that of <span class=
"sc">Auguste Comte</span>, which as set forth in the <i lang="fr">Cours
de Philosophie Positive</i> (1830&ndash;42) practically reaffirmed
while it recast and supplemented the essentials of the anti-theological
rationalism of the previous age, and in that sense rebuilt French
positivism, giving that new name to the naturalistic principle. Though
Comte&rsquo;s direct following was never large, it is significant that
soon after the completion of his <i lang="fr">Cours</i> we find Saisset
lamenting that the war between the clergy and the philosophers,
&ldquo;suspended by the great political commotion of 1830,&rdquo; had
been &ldquo;revived with a new energy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27883src" href="#xd21e27883" name="xd21e27883src">314</a> The
later effort of Comte to frame a politico-ecclesiastical system never
succeeded beyond the formation of a politically powerless sect; and the
attempt to prove its consistency with his philosophic system by
claiming that from the first he had harboured a plan of social
regulation<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27889src" href="#xd21e27889"
name="xd21e27889src">315</a> is beside the case. A man&rsquo;s way of
thinking may involve intellectual contradictions all through his life;
and Comte&rsquo;s did. Positivism in the scientific sense cannot be
committed to any one man&rsquo;s scheme for regulating society and
conserving &ldquo;cultus&rdquo;; and Comte&rsquo;s was merely one of
the many evoked in France by the memory of an age of revolutions. It
belongs, indeed, to the unscientific and unphilosophic side of his
mind, the craving for authority and the temper of ascendency, which
connect with his admiration of the medieval Church. Himself
philosophically an atheist, he condemned atheists because they mostly
contemned his passion for regimentation. By reason of this idiosyncrasy
and of the habitually dictatorial tone of his doctrine, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name="pb484">484</a>]</span>he
has made his converts latterly more from the religious than from the
freethinking ranks. But both in France and in England his philosophy
tinged all the new thought of his time, his leading English adherents
in particular being among the most esteemed publicists of the day.
Above all, he introduced the conception of a &ldquo;science of
society&rdquo; where hitherto there had ruled the haziest forms of
&ldquo;providentialism.&rdquo; In France the general effect of the
rationalistic movement had been such that when <span class=
"sc">Taine</span>, under the Third Empire, assailed the whole
&ldquo;classic&rdquo; school in his <i lang="fr">Philosophes
classiques</i> (1857), his success was at once generally recognized,
and a non-Comtist positivism was thenceforth the ruling philosophy. The
same thing has happened in Italy, where quite a number of university
professors are explicitly positivist in their philosophic
teaching.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27904src" href="#xd21e27904" name=

after Berkeley had been mainly left to Hume and the Scotch thinkers who
opposed him, metaphysics was for a generation practically overriden by
the moral and social sciences; Hartley&rsquo;s Christian Materialism

the Unitarian Priestley. The reaction against the Revolution, indeed,
seems to have evicted everything in the nature of active philosophic

guard against the risk of prosecution by the elaborate stipulation that
what it discusses is always the influence of <i>natural</i> religion on

merest stratagem, the whole drift of the book being a criticism of the
effects of the current religion on contemporary society. It greatly
influenced J. S. Mill, whose essay on <i>The Utility of Religion</i>
echoes its beginning; and if it had been a little less drab in style it
might have influenced many more.</p>
<p class="par">But Bentham&rsquo;s ostensible restriction of his logic
to practical problems of law and morals secured him a wider influence
than was wielded by any of the higher publicists of his day. The whole
tendency of his school was intensely rationalistic; and it indirectly
affected all thought by its treatment of economics, which from Hume and
Smith onwards had been practically divorced from theology. Even
clerical economists, such as Malthus and Chalmers, alike orthodox in
religion, furthered naturalism in philosophy in spite of themselves by
their insistence on the law of population, which is the negation of
divine benevolence as popularly conceived. A not unnatural result was a
religious fear of all reasoning whatever, and a disparagement of the
very faculty of reason. This, however, was sharply resisted by the more
cultured champions of orthodoxy,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27975src"

<p id="ch21.6.10" class="par">10. When English metaphysical philosophy
revived with Sir William Hamilton,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27986src"
href="#xd21e27986" name="xd21e27986src">322</a> it was on the lines of
a dialectical resistance to the pantheism of Germany, in the interests
of faith; though Hamilton&rsquo;s dogmatic views were always
doubtful.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27995src" href="#xd21e27995" name=

fence, he always grounded his theism on the alleged &ldquo;needs of our
moral nature&rdquo;&mdash;a declaration of philosophical bankruptcy.
The vital issue was brought to the front after his death in the Bampton
Lectures (1858) of his supporter Dean Mansel; and between them they
gave the decisive proof that the orthodox cause had been
philosophically lost while being socially won, since their theism
emphasized in the strongest way the negative criticism of Kant, leaving
deity void of all philosophically cognizable qualities. Hamilton and
Mansel alike have received <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href=
"#pb486" name="pb486">486</a>]</span>severe treatment at the hands of
Mill and others for the calculated irrationalism and the consequent
immoralism of their doctrine, which insisted on attributing moral bias
to an admittedly Unknowable Absolute, and on standing for Christian
mysteries on the skeptical ground that reason is an imperfect
instrument, and that our moral faculties and feelings
&ldquo;demand&rdquo; the traditional beliefs. But they did exactly what
was needed to force rationalism upon open and able minds. It is indeed
astonishing to find so constantly repeated by trained reasoners the old
religious blunder of <i>reasoning</i> from the <i>inadequacy</i> of
reason to the need for faith. The disputant says in effect: &ldquo;Our
reason is not to be trusted; let us then on that score rationally
decide to believe what is handed down to us&rdquo;: for if the argument
is not a process of reasoning it is nothing; and if it is to stand, it
is an assertion of the validity it denies. Evidently the number of
minds capable of such self-stultification is great; but among minds at
once honest and competent the number capable of detecting the absurdity
must be considerable; and the invariable result of its use down to our
own time is to multiply unbelievers in the creed so absurdly
defended.</p>
<p class="par">It is difficult to free Mansel from the charge of
seeking to confuse and bewilder; but mere contact with the processes of
reasoning in his Bampton Lectures is almost refreshing after much
acquaintance with the see-saw of vituperation and platitude which up to
that time mostly passed muster for defence of religion in
nineteenth-century England. He made for a revival of intellectual life.
And he suffered enough at the hands of his co-religionists, including
F. D. Maurice, to set up something like compassion in the mind of the
retrospective rationalist. Accused of having adopted &ldquo;the
absolute and infinite, as defined after the leaders of German
metaphysics,&rdquo; as a &ldquo;synonym for the true and living
God,&rdquo; he protested that he had done &ldquo;exactly the reverse. I
assert that the absolute and infinite, as defined in the German
metaphysics, <i>and in all other metaphysics with which I am
acquainted</i>, is a notion which destroys itself by its own
contradictions. I believe <i>also</i> that God is, in some manner
incomprehensible by me, both absolute and infinite; and that those
attributes exist in Him <i>without any repugnance or contradiction at
all</i>. Hence I maintain throughout that <i>the infinite of philosophy
is not the true infinite</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">It was said of Hamilton that, &ldquo;having scratched
his eyes out in the bush of reason, he scratched them in again in the
bush of faith&rdquo;; and when that could obviously be said also of his
reverend pupil, the philosophic tide was clearly on the turn. Within
two years of the delivery of Mansel&rsquo;s lectures his and
Hamilton&rsquo;s philosophic positions were being confidently employed
as an open and avowed basis for the naturalistic <i>First
Principles</i> (1860&ndash;62) of <span class="sc">Herbert
Spencer</span>, wherein, with an unfortunate laxity of metaphysic on
the author&rsquo;s own part, and a no less unfortunate lack of
consistency as regards the criticism of religious and anti-religious
positions,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28052src" href="#xd21e28052"
name="xd21e28052src">326</a> the new cosmic conceptions are unified in
a masterly conception of evolution as a universal law. This service,
the rendering of which was quite beyond the capacity of the multitude
of Spencer&rsquo;s metaphysical critics, marks him as one of the great
influences of his age. Strictly, the book is a &ldquo;System of
Nature&rdquo; rather than a philosophy in the sense of a study of the
grounds and limitations of knowledge; that is to say, it is on the
former ground alone that it is coherent and original. But its very
imperfections on the other side have probably promoted its reception
among minds already shaken in theology by the progress of concrete
science; while at the same time such imperfections give a hostile
foothold to the revived forms of theism. In any case, the
&ldquo;agnostic&rdquo; foundation supplied by the despairing dialectic
of Hamilton and Mansel has always constituted the most effective part
of the Spencerian case.</p>
<p id="ch21.6.11" class="par">11. The effect of the ethical pressure of
the deistic attack on the intelligence of educated Christians was fully
seen even within the Anglican Church before the middle of the century.

modify the doctrine of Atonement <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb488"
href="#pb488" name="pb488">488</a>]</span>on which the conception of
the Trinity was historically founded. In the hands of Maurice the
doctrine of sacrifice became one of example to the end of subjective
regeneration of the sinner. This view, which was developed by John the
Scot&mdash;perhaps from hints in Origen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e28071src" href="#xd21e28071" name=

"xd21e28077src">329</a> is specially associated with the teaching of
Coleridge; but it was quite independently held in England before him by
the Anglican Dr. Parr (1747&ndash;1825), who appears to have been
heterodox upon most points in the orthodox creed,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e28083src" href="#xd21e28083" name="xd21e28083src">330</a> and
who, like Servetus and Coleridge and Hegel, held by a modal as against
a &ldquo;personal&rdquo; Trinity. The advance in ethical sensitiveness
which had latterly marked English thought, and which may perhaps be
traced in equal degrees to the influence of Shelley and to that of
Bentham, counted for much in this shifting of Christian ground. The
doctrine of salvation by faith was by many felt to be morally
indefensible. Such Unitarian accommodations presumably reconciled to
Christianity and the Church many who would otherwise have abandoned
them; and the only orthodox rebuttal seems to have been the old and
dangerous resort to the Butlerian argument, to the effect that the God
of Nature shows no such benign fatherliness as the anti-sacrificial
school ascribe to him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28090src" href=

<p class="par">The same pressure of moral argument was doubtless potent
in the development of &ldquo;Socinian&rdquo; or other rationalistic
views in the Protestant Churches of Germany, Holland, Hungary,
Switzerland, and France in the first half of the century. Such
development had gone so far that by the middle of the century the
Churches in question were, to the eye of an English evangelical
champion, predominantly rationalistic, and in that sense
&ldquo;infidel.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28107src" href=

before and since; but in our own age there is little to show for them.
In the United States, again, the ethical element probably predominated
in the recoil of <span class="sc">Emerson</span> from Christian

<span class="sc">Theodore Parker</span>, whose aversion to the theistic

<p id="ch21.6.12" class="par">12. A powerful and wholesome stimulus was
given to English thought throughout the latter half of the nineteenth
century by the many-sided influence of <span class="sc">John Stuart
Mill</span>, who, beginning by a brilliant <i>System of Logic</i>
(1843), which he followed up with a less durable exposition of the
<i>Principles of Political Economy</i> (1848), became through his
shorter works <i>On Liberty</i> and on various political problems one
of the most popular of the serious writers of his age. It was not till
the posthumous issue of his <i>Autobiography</i> and his <i>Three
Essays on Religion</i> (1874) that many of his readers realized how
complete was his alienation from the current religion, from his
childhood up. In his <i>Examination of Sir William Hamilton&rsquo;s
Philosophy</i> (1865), indeed, he had indignantly repudiated the
worship of an unintelligibly good God; but he had there seemed to take
for granted the God-idea; and save in inconclusive passages in the
<i>Liberty</i> (1859) he had indicated no rejection of Christianity.
But though the <i>Liberty</i> was praised by Kingsley and contemned by
Carlyle, it made for freethinking no less than for tolerance; and his
whole life&rsquo;s work made for reason. &ldquo;The saint of

the strange conception of a limited-liability God, the victim of
circumstances&mdash;a theorem which meets neither the demand for a
theistic explanation of the universe nor the worshipper&rsquo;s craving
for support&mdash;sets up some wonder as to his philosophy; but was
probably as disintegrative of orthodoxy as a more philosophical
performance would have been.</p>

modern period, there is probably as much variety of credence in regard
to religion as occurs in the life of Christendom so called. Such names
as those of Spinoza, Jacobi, Moses Mendelssohn, Heine, and Karl Marx
tell sufficiently of Jewish service to freethought; and each one of
these must have had many disciples of his own race. Deism among the
educated Jews of Germany in the eighteenth century was probably
common.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28163src" href="#xd21e28163" name=

entitled the Gaon, &ldquo;the great one,&rdquo; set up a movement of

of a Rabbinical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490" href="#pb490"

href="#xd21e28178" name="xd21e28178src">337</a> (1851), though not a
scientific work, is ethically and philosophically in advance of the
orthodox Judaism of its age. Of Krochmal it has been said that he
&ldquo;was inspired in his work by the study of Hegel, just as
Maimonides had been by the study of Aristotle.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

<p class="par">To-day educated Jewry is divided in somewhat the same
proportions as Christendom into absolute rationalists and liberal and
fanatical believers; and representatives of all three types, of
different social grades, may be found among the Zionists, whose
movement for the acquisition of a new racial home has attracted so much
attention and sympathy in recent years. Whether or not that movement
attains to any decisive political success, Judaism clearly cannot
escape the solvent influences which affect all European opinion. As in
the case of the Christian Church, the synagogue in the centres of
culture keeps the formal adherence of some who no longer think on its
plane; but while attempts are made from time to time to set up more
rationalistic institutions for Jews with the modern bias, the general
tendency is to a division between devotees of the old forms and those
who have decided to live by reason.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We have already seen, in discussing the culture
histories of India, China, and Moslem Persia, how ancient elements of
rationalism continue to germinate more or less obscurely in the
unpropitious soils of Asiatic life. Ignorance is in most oriental
countries too immensely preponderant to permit of any other species of
survival. But sociology, while recognizing the vast obstacles to the
higher life presented by conditions which with a fatal facility
multiply the lower, can set no limit to the possibilities of upward
evolution. The case of Japan is a sufficient rebuke to the thoughtless
iterators of the formula of the &ldquo;unprogressiveness of the
East.&rdquo; While a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491"
name="pb491">491</a>]</span>cheerfully superstitious religion is there
still normal among the mass, the transformation of the political ideals
and practice of the nation under the influence of European example is
so great as to be unparalleled in human history; and it has inevitably
involved the substitution of rationalism for supernaturalism among the
great majority of the educated younger generation. The late
<span class="sc">Yukichi Fukuzawa</span>, who did more than any other
man to prepare the Japanese mind for the great transformation effected
in his time, was spontaneously a freethinker from his
childhood;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28208src" href="#xd21e28208"
name="xd21e28208src">340</a> and through a long life of devoted
teaching he trained thousands to a naturalist way of thought. That they
should revert to Christian or native orthodoxy seems as impossible as
such an evolution is seen to be in educated Hindostan, where the higher
orders of intelligence are probably not relatively more common than
among the Japanese. The final question, there as everywhere, is one of
social reconstruction and organization; and in the enormous population
of China the problem, though very different in degree of imminence, is
the same in kind. Perhaps the most hopeful consideration of all is that
of the ever-increasing inter-communication which makes European and
American progress tend in every succeeding generation to tell more and
more on Asiatic life.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">As to Japan, Professor B. H. Chamberlain
pronounced twenty years ago that the Japanese &ldquo;now bow down
before the shrine of Herbert Spencer&rdquo; (<i>Things Japanese</i>,
3rd ed. 1898, p. 321. Cp. <i>Religious Systems of the World</i>, 3rd
ed. p. 103), proceeding in another connection (p. 352) to describe them
as <i>essentially</i> an undevotional people. Such a judgment would be
hard to sustain. The Japanese people in the past have exhibited the
amount of superstition normal in their culture stage (cp. the
<i>Voyages de C. P. Thunberg au Japon</i>, French tr. 1796, iii, 206);
and in our own day they differ from Western peoples on this side merely
in respect of their greater general serenity of temperament. There were
in Japan in 1894 no fewer than 71,831 Buddhist temples, and 190,803
Shinto temples and shrines; and the largest temple of all, costing
&ldquo;several million dollars,&rdquo; was built in the last dozen
years of the nineteenth century. To the larger shrines there are
habitual pilgrimages, the numbers annually visiting one leading
Buddhist shrine reaching from 200,000 to 250,000, while at the
Shint&ocirc; shrine of Kompira the pilgrims are said to number about
900,000 each year. (See <i>The Evolution of the Japanese</i>, 1903, by
L. Gulick, an American missionary organizer.) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492" name="pb492">492</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Professor Chamberlain appears to have construed
&ldquo;devotional&rdquo; in the light of a special conception of true
devotion. Yet a Christian observer testifies, of the revivalist sect of
Nichirenites, &ldquo;the Ranters of Buddhism,&rdquo; that &ldquo;the
wildest excesses that seek the mantle of religion in other lands are by
them equalled if not excelled&rdquo; (Griffis, <i>The Mikado&rsquo;s
Empire</i>, 1876, p. 163); and Professor Chamberlain admits that
&ldquo;the religion of the family binds them [the Japanese in general,
including the &lsquo;most materialistic&rsquo;] down in truly sacred
bonds&rdquo;; while another writer, who thinks Christianity desirable
for Japan, though he apparently ranks Japanese morals above Christian,
declares that in his travels he was much reassured by the superstition
of the innkeepers, feeling thankful that his hosts were &ldquo;not
Agnostics or Secularists,&rdquo; but devout believers in future
punishments (Tracy, <i>Rambles through Japan without a Guide</i>, 1892,
pp. 131, 276, etc.).</p>
<p class="par">A third authority with Japanese experience, Professor W.
G. Dixon, while noting a generation ago that &ldquo;among certain
classes in Japan not only religious earnestness but fanaticism and
superstition still prevail,&rdquo; decides that &ldquo;at the same time
it remains true that the Japanese are not in the main a very religious
people, and that at the present day religion is in lower repute than
probably it has ever been in the country&rsquo;s history. Religious
indifference is one of the prominent features of new Japan&rdquo;
(<i>The Land of the Morning</i>, 1882, p. 517). The reconciliation of
these estimates lies in the recognition of the fact that the Japanese
populace is religious in very much the same way as those of Italy and
England, while the more educated classes are rationalistic, not because
of any &ldquo;essential&rdquo; incapacity for &ldquo;devotion,&rdquo;
but because of enlightenment and lack of countervailing social
pressure. To the eye of the devotional Protestant the Catholics of
Italy, with their regard to externals, seem &ldquo;essentially&rdquo;
irreligious; and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Such formulas miss science.
Two hundred years ago Charron, following previous schematists, made a
classification in which northerners figured as strong, active, stupid,
warlike, and little given to religion; the southerners as slight,
abstinent, obstinate, unwarlike, and superstitious; and the
&ldquo;middle&rdquo; peoples as between the two. <i lang="fr">La
Sagesse</i>, liv. i, ch. 42. The cognate formulas of to-day are hardly
more trustworthy. Buddhism triumphed over Shint&ocirc;ism in Japan both
in ancient and modern times precisely because its lore and ritual make
so much more appeal to the devotional sense. (Cp. Chamberlain, pp.
358&ndash;62; Dixon, ch. x; <i>Religious Systems of the World</i>, pp.
103, 111; Griffis, p. 166.) But the &aelig;sthetically charming cult of
the family, with its poetic recognition of ancestral spirits (as to
which see Lafcadio Hearn, <i>Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation</i>,
1904), seems to hold its ground as well as any. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name="pb493">493</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">So universal is sociological like other law that we find
in Japan, among some freethinkers, the same disposition as among some
in Europe to decide that religion is necessary for the people.
Professor Chamberlain (p. 352) cites Fukuzawa, &ldquo;Japan&rsquo;s
most representative thinker and educationist,&rdquo; as openly
declaring that &ldquo;It goes without saying that the maintenance of
peace and security in society requires a religion. For this purpose any
religion will do. I lack a religious nature, and have never believed in
any religion. I am thus open to the charge that I am advising others to
be religious while I am not so. Yet my conscience does not permit me to
clothe myself with religion when I have it not at heart.... Of
religions there are several kinds&mdash;Buddhism, Christianity, and
what not. From my standpoint there is no more difference between those
than between green tea and black.... See that the stock is well
selected and the prices cheap....&rdquo; (<i>Japan Herald</i>,
September 9, 1897). To this view, however, Fukuzawa did not finally
adhere. The Rev. Isaac Dooman, a missionary in Japan who knew him well,
testifies to a change that was taking place in his views in later life
regarding the value of religion. In an unpublished letter to Mr. Robert
Young, of Kobe, Mr. Dooman says that on one occasion, when conversing
on the subject of Christianity, Fukuzawa remarked: &ldquo;There was a
time when I advocated its adoption as a means to elevate our lower
classes; but, after finding out that all Christian countries have their
own lower classes just as bad, if not worse than ours, I changed my
mind.&rdquo; Further reflection, marked by equal candour, may lead the
pupils of Fukuzawa to see that nations cannot be led to adore any form
of &ldquo;tea&rdquo; by the mere assurance of its indispensableness
from leaders who confess they never take any. His view is doubtless
shared by those priests concerning whom &ldquo;it may be questioned
whether in their fundamental beliefs the more scholarly of the
Shinshi&ucirc; priests differ very widely from the materialistic
agnostics of Europe&rdquo; (Dixon, p. 516). In this state of things the
Christian thinks he sees his special opportunity. Professor Dixon
writes (p. 518), in the manner of the missionary, that &ldquo;decaying
shrines and broken gods are to be seen everywhere. Not only is there
indifference, but there is a rapidly-growing skepticism.... The masses
too are becoming affected by it.... Shint&ocirc;ism and ... Buddhism
are doomed. What is to take their place?... It must be either
Christianity or Atheism. We have the brightest hopes that the former
will triumph in the near future....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The American missionary before cited, Mr. Gulick, argues
alternately that the educated Japanese are religious and that they are
not, meaning that they have &ldquo;religious instincts,&rdquo; while
rejecting current creeds. The so-called religious instinct <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href="#pb494" name="pb494">494</a>]</span>is
in fact simply the spirit of moral and intellectual seriousness. Mr.
Gulick&rsquo;s summing-up, as distinct from his theory and forecast, is
as follows: &ldquo;For about three hundred years the intelligence of
the nation has been dominated by Confucian thought, which rejects
active belief in supra-human beings.... The tendency of all persons
trained in Confucian classics was towards thoroughgoing skepticism as
to divine beings and their relation to this world. For this reason,
beyond doubt, has Western agnosticism found so easy an entrance into
Japan.... <i>Complete indifference to religion is characteristic of the
educated classes of to-day.</i> Japanese and foreigners, Christians and
non-Christians alike, unite in this opinion. The impression usually
conveyed by this statement, however, is that agnosticism is a new thing
in Japan. In point of fact, the old agnosticism is merely reinforced by
... the agnosticism of the West&rdquo; (<i>The Evolution of the
Japanese</i>, pp. 286&ndash;87). This may be taken as broadly accurate.
Cp. the author&rsquo;s paper on &ldquo;Freethought in Japan&rdquo; in
the <i>Agnostic Annual</i> for 1906. Professor E. H. Parker notes
(<i>China and Religion</i>, 1905, p. 263) that &ldquo;the Japanese in
translating Western books are beginning, to the dismay of our
missionaries, to leave out all the Christianity that is in
them.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">But a very grave danger to the intellectual and moral
life of Japan has been of late set up by a new application of
Shint&ocirc;ism, on the lines of the emperor-worship of ancient Rome. A
recent pamphlet by Professor Chamberlain, entitled <i>The Invention of
a New Religion</i> (R. P. A.; 1912), incidentally shows that the
Japanese temperament is so far from being &ldquo;essentially&rdquo;
devoid of devotion as to be capable of building up a fresh cultus to
order. It appears that since the so-called Restoration of 1868, when
the Imperial House, after more than two centuries of seclusion in
Kyoto, was brought from its retirement and the Emperor publicly
installed as ruler by right of his divine origin, the sentiment of
religious devotion to the Imperial House has been steadily inculcated,
reaching its height during the Russo-Japanese War, when the messages of
victorious generals and admirals piously ascribed their successes over
the enemy to the &ldquo;virtues of the Imperial Ancestors.&rdquo; In
every school throughout the Empire there hangs a portrait of the
emperor, which is regarded and treated as is a sacred image in Russia
and in Catholic countries. The curators of schools have been known on
occasion of fire and earthquake to save the imperial portrait before
wife or child; and their action has elicited popular acclamation. On
the imperial birthday teachers and pupils assemble, and passing singly
before the portrait, bow in solemn adoration. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495" name="pb495">495</a>]</span>The
divine origin of the Imperial House and the grossly mythical history of
the early emperors are taught as articles of faith in Japanese schools
precisely as the cosmogony of Genesis has been taught for ages in the
schools of Christendom<span class="corr" id="xd21e28289" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> Some years ago a professor who exposed the
absurdity of the chronology upon which the religion is based was
removed from his post, and a teacher who declined to bow before a
casket containing an imperial rescript was dismissed. His life was, in
fact, for some time in danger from the fury of the populace. So
dominant has Mikado-worship become that some Japanese Christian pastors
have endeavoured to reconcile it with Christianity, and to be
Mikado-worshippers and Christ-worshippers at the same time.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e28292src" href="#xd21e28292" name=
"xd21e28292src">341</a> All creeds are nominally tolerated in Japan,
but avowed heresy as to the divine origin of the Imperial House is a
bar to public employment, and exposes the heretic to suspicion of
treason. The new religion, which is merely old Shint&ocirc;ism revised,
has been invented as a political expedient, and may possibly not long
survive the decease of Mutsu Hito, the late emperor, who continued
throughout his reign to live in comparative seclusion, and has been
succeeded by a young prince educated on European lines. But the cult
has obtained a strong hold upon the people; and by reason of social
pressure receives the conventional support of educated men exactly as
Christianity does in England, America, Germany, and Russia.</p>
<p class="par">Thus there is not &ldquo;plain sailing&rdquo; for
freethought in Japan. In such a political atmosphere neither moral nor
scientific thought has a good prognosis; and if it be not changed for
the better much of the Japanese advance may be lost. Rationalism on any
large scale is always a product of culture; and culture for the mass of
the people of Japan has only recently begun. Down till the middle of
the nineteenth century nothing more than sporadic freethought
existed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28297src" href="#xd21e28297" name=
"xd21e28297src">342</a> Some famous captains were irreverent as to the
omens; and in a seventeenth-century manual of the principles of
government, ascribed to the great founder of modern feudalism,
Iy&eacute;yasu, the sacrifices of vassals at the graves of their lords
are denounced, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name=

burial of effigies in substitution.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e28317src" href="#xd21e28317" name="xd21e28317src">343</a> But, as
elsewhere under similar conditions, such displays of originality were
confined to the ruling caste.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28323src"
href="#xd21e28323" name="xd21e28323src">344</a> I have seen, indeed, a
delightful popular satire, apparently a product of mother-wit, on the
methods of popular Buddhist shrine-making; but, supposing it to be
genuine and vernacular, it can stand only for that measure of
freethought which is never absent from any society not pithed by a long
process of religious tyranny. Old Japan, with its intense feudal
discipline and its indurated etiquette, exhibited the social order, the
grace, the moral charm, and the intellectual vacuity of a hive of bees.
The higher mental life was hardly in evidence; and the ethical
literature of native inspiration is of no importance.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e28329src" href="#xd21e28329" name="xd21e28329src">345</a> To
this day the educated Chinese, though lacking in Japanese
&ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; and devotion to drill of all kinds, are the
more freely intellectual in their habits of mind. The Japanese feudal
system, indeed, was so immitigably ironbound, so incomparably
destructive of individuality in word, thought, and deed, that only in
the uncodified life of art and handicraft was any free play of faculty
possible. What has happened of late is the rapid and docile
assimilation of western science. Another and a necessarily longer step
is the independent development of the speculative and critical
intelligence; and in the East, as in the West, this is subject to
economic conditions.</p>
<p class="par">A similar generalization holds good as to the other
Oriental civilizations. Analogous developments to those seen in the
latter-day Mohammedan world, and equally marked by fluctuation, have
been noted in the mental life alike of the non-Mohammedan and the
Mohammedan peoples of India; and at the present day the thought of the
relatively small educated class is undoubtedly much affected by the
changes going on in that of Europe, and especially of England. The vast
Indian masses, however, are far from anything in the nature of critical
culture; and though some system of education for them is probably on
the way to establishment,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28337src" href=
"#xd21e28337" name="xd21e28337src">346</a> their life must long remain
quasi-primitive, mentally as well as physically. Buddhism is
theoretically more capable of adaptation to a rationalist view of life
than is Christianity; but its intellectual activities at present seem
to tend more towards an &ldquo;esoteric&rdquo; credulity than towards a
rational or scientific adjustment to life. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb497" href="#pb497" name="pb497">497</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Of the nature of the influence of Buddhism in
Burmah, where it has prospered, a vivid and thoughtful account is given
in the work of H. Fielding, <i>The Soul of a People</i>, 1898. At its
best the cult there deifies the Buddha; elsewhere, it is interwoven
with aboriginal polytheism and superstition (Davids, <i>Buddhism</i>,
pp. 207&ndash;211; Max M&uuml;ller, <i>Anthro. Rel.</i>, P. 132).</p>
<p class="par">Within Brahmanism, again, there have been at different
times attempts to set up partly naturalistic reforms in religious
thought&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> that of Chaitanya in the sixteenth century;
but these have never been pronouncedly freethinking, and Chaitanya
preached a &ldquo;surrender of all to Krishna,&rdquo; very much in the
manner of evangelical Christianity. Finally he has been deified by his
followers. (M&uuml;ller, <i>Nat. Rel.</i> p. 100; <i>Phys. Rel.</i> p.
356.)</p>
<p class="par">More definitely freethinking was the monotheistic cult
set up among the Sikhs in the fifteenth century, as the history runs,
by Nanak, who had been influenced both by Parsees and by Mohammedans,
and whose ethical system repudiated caste. But though Nanak objected to
any adoration of himself, he and all his descendants have been
virtually deified by his devotees, despite their profession of a
theoretically pantheistic creed. (Cp. De la Saussaye, <i>Manual of the
Science of Religion</i>, Eng. tr. pp. 659&ndash;62; M&uuml;ller,
<i>Phys. Rel.</i> p. 355.) Trumpp (<i lang="de">Die Religion der
Sikhs</i>, 1881, p. 123) tells of other Sikh sects, including one of a
markedly atheistic character belonging to the nineteenth century; but
all alike seem to gravitate towards Hinduism.</p>
<p class="par">Similarly among the Jainas, who compare with the
Buddhists in their nominal atheism as in their tenderness to animals
and in some other respects, there has been decline and compromise; and
their numbers appear steadily to dwindle, though in India they survived
while Buddhism disappeared. Cp. De la Saussaye, <i>Manual</i>, pp.
557&ndash;63; Rev. J. Robson, <i>Hinduism</i>, 1874, pp. 80&ndash;86;
Tiele, <i>Outlines</i>, p. 141. Finally, the Brahmo-Somaj movement of
the nineteenth century appears to have come to little in the way of
rationalism (Mitchell, <i>Hinduism</i>, pp. 224&ndash;46; De la
Saussaye, pp. 669&ndash;71; Tiele, p. 160).</p>

<p class="par">The principle of the interdependence of the external and
the internal life, finally, applies even in the case of Turkey. The
notion that Turkish civilization in Europe is unimprovable, though
partly countenanced by despondent thinkers even among the enlightened
Turks,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28398src" href="#xd21e28398" name=
"xd21e28398src">347</a> had no justification in social science, though
bad politics may ruin the Turkish, like other Moslem States; and
although Turkish freethinking has not in general passed the theistic
stage,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28404src" href="#xd21e28404" name=
"xd21e28404src">348</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href=
"#pb498" name="pb498">498</a>]</span>and its spread is grievously
hindered by the national religiosity,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e28420src" href="#xd21e28420" name="xd21e28420src">349</a> which
the age-long hostility of the Christian States so much tends to
intensify, a gradual improvement in the educational and political
conditions would suffice to evolve it, according to the observed laws
of all civilization. It may be that a result of the rationalistic
evolution in the other European States will be to make them
intelligently friendly to such a process, where at present they are
either piously malevolent towards the rival creed or merely
self-seeking as against each other&rsquo;s influence on Turkish
destinies.</p>
<p class="par">In any case, it cannot seriously be pretended that the
mental life of Christian Greece in modern times has yielded, apart from
services to simple scholarship, a much better result to the world at
large than has that of Turkey. The usual reactions in individual cases
of course take place. An American traveller writing in 1856 notes how
illiterate Greek priests glory in their ignorance, &ldquo;asserting
that a more liberal education has the effect of making atheists of the
youth.&rdquo; He adds that he has &ldquo;known several deacons and
others in the University [of Athens] that were skeptics even as to the
truth of religion,&rdquo; and would gladly have become laymen if they
could have secured a livelihood.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28425src"
href="#xd21e28425" name="xd21e28425src">350</a> But there was then and
later in the century no measurable movement of a rationalistic kind. At
the time of the emancipation the Greek priesthood was &ldquo;in general
at once the most ignorant and the most vicious portion of the
community&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28431src" href=
"#xd21e28431" name="xd21e28431src">351</a> and it remained socially
predominant and reactionary. &ldquo;Whatever progress has been made in
Greece has received but little assistance from them.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e28436src" href="#xd21e28436" name=
"xd21e28436src">352</a> Liberal-minded professors in the theological
school were mutinied against by bigoted students,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e28443src" href="#xd21e28443" name="xd21e28443src">353</a> a type
still much in evidence at Athens; and the liberal thinker Theophilus
Ka&iuml;res, charged with teaching &ldquo;atheistic doctrines,&rdquo;
and found guilty with three of his followers, died of jail fever while
his appeal to the Areopagus was pending.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e28450src" href="#xd21e28450" name="xd21e28450src">354</a></p>
<p class="par">Thus far Christian bigotry seems to have held its own in
what once was Hellas. On the surface, Greece shows little trace of
instructed freethought; while in Bulgaria, by Greek testimony, school
teachers openly proclaim their rationalism, and call for the exclusion
of religious teaching from the schools.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e28459src" href="#xd21e28459" name="xd21e28459src">355</a> Despite
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb499" href="#pb499" name=
"pb499">499</a>]</span>political freedom of the Christian State, there
has thus far occurred there no such general fertilization by the
culture of the rest of Europe as is needed to produce a new
intellectual evolution of any importance. The mere geographical
isolation of modern Greece from the main currents of European thought
and commerce is probably the most retardative of her conditions; and it
is hard to see how it can be countervailed. Italy, in comparison, is
pulsating with original life, industrial and intellectual. But, given
either a renascence of Mohammedan civilization or a great political
reconstruction such as is latterly on foot, the whole life of the
nearer East may take a new departure; and in such an evolution Greece
would be likely to share.</p>

Sometimes he gives a clue; and we find Brougham privately denouncing
him for his remark (Essay on <i>Ranke&rsquo;s History of the Popes</i>,
6th par.) that to try &ldquo;without the help of revelation to prove
the immortality of man&rdquo; is vain. &ldquo;It is next thing to
preaching atheism,&rdquo; shouts Brougham (Letter of October 20, 1840,
in <i>Correspondence of Macvey Napier</i>, p. 333), who at the same
time hotly insisted that Cuvier had made an advance in Natural Theology
by proving that there must have been <i>one</i> divine interposition

Abernethy is typical of the orthodox malignity of the time. Cabanis in
his preface had expressly contended for the all-importance of morals.
The orthodox Dr. Cerise, who edited his book in 1843, while
acknowledging the high character of Cabanis, thought fit to speak of
&ldquo;the materialists&rdquo; as &ldquo;interested in abasing
man&rdquo; (introd. p. xxi). On the score of fear of demoralization,

Spencer has avowed in his <i>Autobiography</i> (ii, 75) what might be
surmized by critical readers, that he wrote the First Part of <i>First
Principles</i> in order to guard against the charge of
&ldquo;materialism.&rdquo; This motive led him to misrepresent
&ldquo;atheism,&rdquo; and there was a touch of retribution in the
general disregard of his disavowal of materialism, at which he
expresses surprise. The broad fact remains that for prudential reasons
he set forth at the very outset of his system a set of conclusions
which could properly be reached only at the end, if at
all.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e28052src">&uarr;</a></p>

curious example of sporadic freethought occurs in a pamphlet published
towards the end of the eighteenth century. In 1771 a writer named
Moto&#333;ri began a propaganda in favour of Shint&ocirc;ism with the
publication of a tract entitled <i>Spirit of Straightening</i>. This
tract emphatically asserted the divinity of the Mikado, and elicited a
reply from another writer named Ichikawa, who wrote: &ldquo;The
Japanese word <i>kami</i> (God) was simply a title of honour; but in
consequence of its having been used to translate the Chinese character
<i>shin</i> (<i>sh&ecirc;n</i>) a meaning has come to be attached to it
which it did not originally possess. The ancestors of the Mikados were
not Gods, but men, and were no doubt worthy to be reverenced for their
virtues; but their acts were not miraculous nor supernatural. If the
ancestors of living men were not human beings, they are more likely to
have been birds or beasts than Gods.&rdquo; Art.: &ldquo;The Revival of

<h2 class="main">CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Any fuller survey of the intellectual history of
the nineteenth century will but reveal more fully the signal and
ever-widening growth of rational thought among all classes of the more
advanced nations, and among the more instructed of the less advanced.
The retrospect of the whole past tells of a continuous evolution, which
in the twentieth century proceeds more extensively than ever before.
There has emerged the curious fact that in our own country a measure of
rational doubt has been almost constantly at work in the sphere in
which it could perhaps least confidently be expected&mdash;to wit, that
of poetry. From Chaucer onwards it is hard to find a great orthodox
poet. Even Spenser was as much Platonist as Christian; and Marlowe,
Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Burns, Wordsworth, Shelley, Byron,
Coleridge, Keats, Tennyson, Arnold, and Browning (to name no others) in
their various ways baffle the demand of faith. Latterly, the sex which
has always been reckoned the more given to religion has shown many
signs of adaptation to the higher law. In Britain, as in France, women
began to appear in the ranks of reason in the eighteenth
century.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28472src" href="#xd21e28472" name=
"xd21e28472src">1</a> In the nineteenth the number has increased at a
significant rate. Already in the fierce battles fought in the time of
reaction after the French Revolution women took their place on the side
of freedom; and Frances Wright (Madame d&rsquo;Arusmont) played a
notable part as a freethinking publicist and philanthropist.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e28478src" href="#xd21e28478" name=
"xd21e28478src">2</a> Since her day the names of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb500" href="#pb500" name=
"pb500">500</a>]</span>Harriet Martineau and George Eliot tell of the
continual gain of knowledge; and women rationalists are now to be
counted by thousands in all the more civilized countries.</p>
<p class="par">The same law holds of public life in general. Gladstone
eagerly maintained in his latter years that politicians, in virtue of
their practical hold of life, were little given to skepticism; but the
facts were and are increasingly against him. The balance of the
evidence is against the ascription of orthodoxy to either of the Pitts,
or to Fox; and we have seen that the statesmen of the American
Revolution, as of the French, were in general deists.
Garibaldi<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28488src" href="#xd21e28488" name=
"xd21e28488src">3</a> in Italy, and Gambetta in France, were
freethinkers; Lincoln and his opponent, Douglas, were deists; towards
the close of the century, in New Zealand, Sir Robert Stout and the late
Mr. John Ballance, avowed rationalists, were among the foremost
politicians of their generation; and in the English Cabinet rationalism
began to be represented in the person of Lord Morley.</p>
<p class="par">While such developments have been possible in the fierce
light of political strife, the process of disintegration and
decomposition has proceeded in society at large till unbelief can
hardly be reckoned a singularity. Within the pale of all the Christian
Churches dogmatic belief has greatly dwindled, and goes on dwindling:
and &ldquo;Christianity&rdquo; is made to figure more and more as an
ethical doctrine which has abandoned its historical foundations, while
preserving formulas and rituals which have no part in rational ethics.
The mythical cosmogony out of which the whole originally grew is no
longer believed in by any educated person, though it is habitually
presented to the young as divine truth. Thousands of clergymen,
economically gripped to a false position, would gladly rectify their
professed creeds, but cannot; because the political and economic bases
involve the consent of the majority, and changes cannot be made without
angry resistance and uproar among the less instructed multitude of all
classes. The Protestant Churches collectively dread to figure as
repudiating the historic creed; while the Roman Catholic Church,
conscious of the situation, maintains a semblance of rigid discipline
and a minimum standard of instruction for its adherents, counting on
holding its ground while the faculty of uncritical faith subsists. Only
by the silent alienation of the more thoughtful and sincere minds from
the priesthood can the show of orthodoxy be maintained even within the
Catholic pale.</p>
<p class="par">In all orders alike, nevertheless, the
&ldquo;practice&rdquo; of religion decays <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb501" href="#pb501" name="pb501">501</a>]</span>with the theory. The
Churches are constantly challenged to justify their existence by social
reforms and philanthropic works: no other plea passes as generally
valid; and it is only by reason of a general transference of interest
from religious to social problems that the decay of belief is
disguised. &ldquo;Piety,&rdquo; in the old sense, counts relatively for
little; and while orthodoxy is still a means of advantage in political
life, religion counts for nothing in international relations. In the
war of 1899&ndash;1902, &ldquo;Bible-loving&rdquo; England forced a
quarrel on the most Bible-loving race in the world; and at the time of
the penning of these lines six nations are waging the greatest war of
all time irrespectively of racial and religious ties alike, though all
alike officially claim the support of Omnipotence. In Berlin a popular
preacher edifies great audiences by proclaiming that &ldquo;God is not
neutral&rdquo;; and his Emperor habitually parades the same faith, with
the support of all the theologians of Germany&mdash;the State supremely
guilty of the whole embroilment, and the deliberate perpetrator of the
grossest aggression in modern history. On the side of the Allies
&ldquo;Christianity&rdquo; is less systematically but still frequently
invoked. On both sides the forms of prayer are officially practised by
the non-combatants, very much as the Romans in their wars maintained
the practice of augury from the entrails of sacrificed victims; and
&ldquo;family prayer&rdquo; is said to be reviving.</p>
<p class="par">Everywhere, nevertheless, the more rational, remembering
how in the &ldquo;ages of faith&rdquo; deadly wars were waged for whole
generations in the very name of religion, recognize that Christianity
furnishes neither control for the present nor solution for the future;
and that the hope of civilization lies in the resort of the nations to
human standards of sanity and reciprocity. The ties which hold are
those of fellow-citizenship.</p>
<p class="par">There can be no doubt among rationalists that if modern
civilization escapes the ruin which militarism brought upon those of
all previous eras, the principle of reason will continually widen its
control, latterly seen to be everywhere strengthening apart from the
dangerous persistence of militarist ideals and impulses. When it
controls international relations, it will be dominant in the life of
thought. In the words of a great fighter for freethought, &ldquo;No man
ever saw a religion die&rdquo;; and there are abundant survivals of
pre-Christian paganism in Europe after two thousand years of
Christianity; but it seems likely that when the history of the
twentieth century is written it will be recognized that what has
historically figured as religion belongs in all its forms to the
past.</p>
<p class="par">The question is sometimes raised whether the age of
decline will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href="#pb502" name=
"pb502">502</a>]</span>be marked by movements of active and persecuting
fanaticism. Here, again, the answer must be that everything depends
upon the general fortunes of civilization. It is significant that a
number of clerical voices proclaim a revival of religion as a product
of war, while others complain that the state of struggle has a
sterilizing effect upon religious life. While organized religions
subsist, there will always be adherents with the will to persecute; and
from time to time acts of public persecution occur, in addition to many
of a private character. But in Britain public persecution is latterly
restricted to cases in which the technical offence of
&ldquo;blasphemy&rdquo; is associated with acts which come under
ordinary police jurisdiction. After the unquestionable blasphemies of
Arnold and Swinburne had to be officially ignored, it became
impossible, in the present stage of civilization, that any serious and
decent literary indictment of the prevailing creeds should be made a
subject of persecution; and before long, probably, such indictments
will be abandoned in the cases of offenders against police
regulations.</p>
<p class="par">The main danger appears to lie in Catholic countries,
and from the action of the Catholic hierarchy. The common people
everywhere, save in the most backward countries, are increasingly
disinclined to persecution. In Ireland there is much less of that
spirit among the Catholic population than among that of Protestant
Ulster. But the infamous execution of Francisco Ferrer in Spain, in
1909, which aroused passionate reprobation in every civilized country,
was defended in England and elsewhere with extravagant baseness by
Catholic <i lang="fr">litt&eacute;rateurs</i>, who, with their
reactionary priests, are the last to learn the lesson of tolerance. The
indignation everywhere excited by the judicial murder<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e28513src" href="#xd21e28513" name="xd21e28513src">4</a> of
Ferrer, however, gives promise that even the most zealous fanatics of
the Catholic Church will hesitate again to rouse the wrath of the
nations by such a reversion to the methods of the eras of religious
rule. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503" name=

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Short History of Freethought Ancient
and Modern, Volume 2 of 2, by John M. Robertson

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FREETHOUGHT ***

***** This file should be named 52160-h.htm or 52160-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:
        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/2/1/6/52160/

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
